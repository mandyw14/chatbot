TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs), measured using TMS-electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), have been suggested as potential biomarker candidates, with the N100 peak being one of the most promising. This study investigated the association between baseline N100 amplitude and 1 Hz right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R-DLPFC) accelerated rTMS (arTMS) treatment in MDD.
METHODS: Baseline TMS-EEG sessions were performed for 23 MDD patients. All patients then underwent 40 sessions of 1 Hz R-DLPFC (F4) arTMS over 5 days and a follow-up TMS-EEG session one week after the end of theses arTMS sessions.
RESULTS: Baseline N100 amplitude at F4 showed a strong positive association (p < .001) with treatment outcome. The association between the change in N100 amplitude (baseline to follow-up) and treatment outcome did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction (p = .06, corrected; p = .03, uncorrected). Furthermore, treatment responders had a significantly larger mean baseline F4 TEP amplitude during the N100 time frame compared to non-responders (p < .001). Topographically, after Bonferroni correction, F4 is the only electrode at which its baseline N100 amplitude showed a significant positive association (p < .001) with treatment outcome.
LIMITATIONS: Lack of control group and auditory masking.
CONCLUSION: Baseline N100 amplitude showed a strong association with treatment outcome and thus demonstrated great potential to be utilized as a cost-effective and widely adoptable biomarker of rTMS treatment in MDD.","Declaration of competing interest JZS, FMazza, DM, FMansouri, TR, RZ, MH, LF, HV, EBA do not report any conflict of interest.

Most commonly diagnosed in childhood and adolescence, it can result in years of struggle and has been listed among the top ten causes of disability by the World Health Organization. Zinc is physiologically essential and integral for optimal health; however, zinc deficiency is quite prevalent. Not only are youth (particularly females) more likely to have zinc deficiency risk factors, but they are also in a life stage where zinc deficiency is more problematic, based on its importance developmentally. Neural zinc levels have implications for neuroplasticity (a factor in cognitive flexibility, a feature of executive function that is impaired in OCD). Additionally, zinc supplementation has been demonstrated to improve mental health, and in animal models, zinc deficiency has been shown to alter the gut microbiota. Gut microbiota profiles have been linked to anxiety and depression (potentially due to interactions with the enteric nervous system). Given the high co-occurrence rates between these and OCD, as well as the fact that patients with OCD have been reported to have higher rates of gastrointestinal distress than controls, an investigation into nutrition and gut microbiota profiles in youth with OCD is a logical step. The aim of this study was to assess the role of zinc and of the gut microbiota in OCD in youth, and to determine any differences between youth with and without OCD. It was hypothesized that higher zinc intake and status, as well as greater gut microbial diversity, would be associated with greater cognitive flexibility and with decreased OCD symptom severity. It was also thought that youth with OCD would be more likely to have non-optimal nutrient intake/levels and dysregulation of gut microbiota than youth without OCD. Zinc status analysis was conducted via 3-day dietary record, serum levels, and hair levels. Berg’s Card-Sorting Test and Trail-Making Tests A&B were used to assess cognitive flexibility; clinical interview and self-report scales measured anxiety, depression, and OCD symptoms; and gut microbiota was quantified via stool samples analyzed using qPCR and 16S sequencing. Data were compared for youth with OCD versus youth without OCD. Commonalities among dietary intake patterns and nutrient status for youth with OCD, as well as their gut microbiota profiles in comparison to youth without OCD, will be discussed. Nutritional status’ impact on mental health is underexplored, and no literature to date combines analysis of zinc, cognitive flexibility, and gut microbiota, particularly in OCD. This study’s characterization of nutrient intake/status and gut microbiota has the potential to aid development of alternative therapies for youth with OCD.

However, precise estimates of differences in prevalence between individuals with EDs and controls are unclear. We compared the prevalence of NSSI, suicidal ideation (SI), suicide attempts (SA), and deaths by suicide in controls and individuals with EDs.
METHOD: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL for peer-reviewed publications reporting the prevalence of NSSI and/or STBs in EDs and HC or PC group (PROSPERO: CRD42021286754). A series of random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) for NSSI, SI, SA, and death by suicide in EDs.
RESULTS: Across 32 studies, individuals with an ED had a significantly increased prevalence of NSSI (HC: OR = 6.85 [95% CI: 3.60, 13.04]; PC: OR = 2.74 [95% CI: 1.49, 5.06]), SI (HC: OR = 3.63 [95% CI: 2.43, 5.41]; PC: OR = 3.10 [95% CI: 2.01, 4.78]), and SA (HC: OR = 5.16 [95% CI: 4.27, 6.24]; PC: OR = 1.37 [95% CI: 0.37, 4.99]) relative to HC and PC groups. A 2.93-times increased odd of death by suicide did not achieve statistical significance. There was a high-level of heterogeneity between studies.
DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that ED populations have an increased prevalence of NSSI, SI, and SA but not death by suicide compared to controls and emphasize the need for effective clinical strategies to address these behaviors in ED populations.
PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: This review provides evidence for an increased prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts in populations with eating disorders compared to controls. Our findings emphasize the need for effective clinical strategies to address these behaviors in patients with eating disorders.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Dr. Devoe acknowledges support from post‐doctoral fellowship awards from the O&#x27;Brien Institute of Public Health, the Mathison Centre for Mental Health, and the Cumming School of Medicine.

The critical brain hypothesis is based in statistical physics and posits that the brain self-tunes its dynamics to a critical point or regime to maximize the repertoire of neuronal responses. Yet, the robustness of this regime, especially with respect to changes in the functional connectivity, remains an unsolved fundamental challenge. Here, we show that both scale-free neuronal dynamics and self-similar features of behavioral dynamics persist following significant changes in functional connectivity. Specifically, we find that the psychedelic compound ibogaine that is associated with an altered state of consciousness fundamentally alters the functional connectivity in the retrosplenial cortex of mice. Yet, the scale-free statistics of movement and of neuronal avalanches among behaviorally related neurons remain largely unaltered. This indicates that the propagation of information within biological neural networks is robust to changes in functional organization of subpopulations of neurons, opening up a new perspective on how the adaptive nature of functional networks may lead to optimality of information transmission in the brain.","Acknowledgments.

Sex differences in post-stroke OSA remain underexplored. The objective of this study was to evaluate sex differences in functional outcomes, stroke and OSA severity, and clinical manifestations of OSA in stroke patients with OSA.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated data from three previously conducted studies. Study patients had an imaging-confirmed stroke and had been found to have OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 5) on either in-laboratory polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing performed within 1 year of their stroke. Linear regression models were used to evaluate study outcomes.
RESULTS: In total, 171 participants with post-stroke OSA (117 males [68.4%] and 54 females [31.6%]) were included. Female sex was an independent predictor for greater functional impairment (β = 0.37, 95% CI 0.029-0.71, p = 0.03), increased stroke severity (β = 1.009, 95% CI 0.032-1.99, p = 0.04), and greater post-stroke depressive symptoms (β = 3.73, 95% CI 0.16-7.29, p = 0.04). Female sex was associated with lower OSA severity, as measured by the AHI (β = -5.93, 95% CI -11.21- -0.66). Sex was not an independent predictor of specific symptoms of OSA such as daytime sleepiness, snoring, tiredness, and observed apneas.
CONCLUSION: Females with post-stroke OSA had poorer functional outcomes and more severe strokes compared to males, despite having lower OSA severity. Females with post-stroke OSA also exhibited more depressive symptoms. Understanding sex differences in patients with post-stroke OSA will likely facilitate better recognition of OSA and potentially improve clinical outcomes.",None.,"Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Canadian Stroke Network, Innovation Fund of the Alternative Funding Plan of the Academic Health Science Centres of Ontario, and Branch Out Neurological Foundation.",Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences / Journal Canadien des Sciences Neurologiques,,,"Humans; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Stroke; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Sex Characteristics; Polysomnography; Severity of Illness Index",2023-10-18,2023,2023-10-18,2024-07,51,4,557-563,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Dharmakulaseelan, Laavanya; Black, Sandra E.; Swartz, Richard H.; Murray, Brian J.; Boulos, Mark I.","Dharmakulaseelan, Laavanya (Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Hurvitz Brain Sciences Research Program, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada); Black, Sandra E.

The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether a 12-week exercise intervention would improve white matter integrity in the brain, or cognition, symptoms of fatigue, and depressed mood for individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).MethodThirteen participants completed 12 weeks of speeded walking. Baseline and post-intervention testing included 3T diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess white matter and neuropsychological testing to assess cognition, fatigue, and mood. Image pre-processing and analyses were performed in functional magnetic resonance imaging of the Brain Software Library.ResultsPost-intervention, there were no significant changes in white matter compared to baseline. Post-intervention, individuals with RRMS performed significantly better on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), reported fewer perceived memory problems, and endorsed less fatigue. Performance was not significantly different on Trails or Digit Span, and there were no significant changes in reports of mood.ConclusionAlthough 12 weeks of speeded walking did not improve white matter integrity, exercise may hold promise for managing some symptoms of RRMS in the context of this study population.","We wish to thank the individuals with MS with whom we consulted about this study as well as the individuals with MS who participated in our study.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine if CRE during routine inpatient stroke rehabilitation is associated with improved recovery of motor and cognitive function, functional ambulation, and motor impairment.
METHODS: People (n = 503) admitted to 2 rehabilitation hospitals over 14 months were included in this cohort study. Participants were classified into 3 groups: ""Prescribed,"" where participants completed CRE that was included in their treatment plan; ""Incidental,"" where they completed CRE that was not included in their treatment plan; and ""None,"" where they did not complete any CRE. Analysis of covariance compared Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), and Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA) scores between groups at discharge, controlling for age, length of stay, comorbidities and scores at baseline. Multiple linear regression determined the relationship between time spent doing CRE during rehabilitation and admission to discharge change in FIM, FAC and CMSA scores, controlling for age, length of stay, comorbidities, and site.
RESULTS: The Prescribed group had higher FIM total and motor sub-scores at discharge than the None (Site A; P < 0.001) or the Incidental group (Site B; P < 0.03). There were significant positive correlations between time spent doing CRE during rehabilitation and change in all outcomes (r > 0.15), except CMSA hand scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings support that CRE during routine inpatient rehabilitation early post-stroke is associated with improved functional independence, ambulation and motor recovery. However, given that the observational design limits causal inferences, controlled studies are needed to confirm the benefits of CRE early post-stroke.",Declaration of competing interest None.

High frequency (HF) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) rTMS has been reported to induce significant changes in the cardiac activity of MDD patients. Low frequency DLPFC rTMS has many advantages over HF-DLPFC rTMS and thus this study aims to further investigate the effect of low frequency 1 Hz right hemisphere (R)-DLPFC rTMS on the cardiac activity of MDD patients, as well as the potential of using electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters as biomarkers of treatment outcome.
METHODS: Baseline ECG sessions were performed for 19 MDD patients. All patients then underwent 40 sessions of accelerated 1 Hz R-DLPFC rTMS one week after the baseline session.
RESULTS: Heart rate (HR) significantly decreased from the resting period to the first and third minute of the 1 Hz R-DLPFC rTMS period. Resting HR was found to have a significant negative association with treatment outcome. Prior to Bonferroni correction, HR during stimulation and the degree of rTMS-induced HR reduction were significantly negatively associated with treatment outcome. No significant changes were observed for the heart rate variability (HRV) parameters.
LIMITATIONS: Sample size (n = 19); the use of electroencephalography equipment for ECG; lack of respiration monitoring; relatively short recording duration for HRV parameters.
CONCLUSION: This novel study provides further preliminary evidence that ECG may be utilized as a biomarker of rTMS treatment response in MDD.

Previous data suggests that pairing iTBS with D-cycloserine, a partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist, improves antidepressant outcomes. However, its impact on suicide risk is not known.
METHODS: We examine suicidal ideation and implicit suicide risk after iTBS+D-cycloserine in two clinical trials (open-label trial [n = 12] and randomized placebo-controlled trial [RCT, n = 50]) involving adults with major depressive disorder and the acute effects of D-cycloserine on implicit suicide risk in a crossover trial (n = 18). Implicit suicide risk was assessed using the computerized death/suicide implicit association test (IAT), and depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were assessed using the clinician-rated Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).
RESULTS: Open-label iTBS+D-cycloserine was associated with a rapid reduction in suicidal ideation, and iTBS+D-cycloserine was superior to iTBS+placebo in reducing suicidal ideation. Similarly, open-label iTBS+D-cycloserine was associated with decreased implicit suicide risk as measured by the death/suicide IAT, and iTBS+D-cycloserine was associated with greater decreases in death/suicide IAT scores compared to iTBS+placebo. A single acute dose of D-cycloserine in the absence of iTBS had no effect on implicit suicide risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive D-cycloserine with iTBS is a promising strategy to reduce suicidal ideation and implicit suicide risk in depression.",,"This study was funded through the Brain and Behaviour Research Foundation (BBRF) 2018 Young Investigator Award (AM), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR—AM), and the University of Calgary Mental Health Initiative for Stress and Trauma (MIST).

Methods: We used two-photon microscopy to record from the retrosplenial cortex in head-fixed mice running on a treadmill before and after injection of the nonclassic psychedelic ibogaine (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally).
Results: We found that the cognitive map, formed by the representation of position encoded by ensembles of individual neurons in the retrosplenial cortex, was destabilized by ibogaine when mice had to infer position between tactile landmarks. This corresponded with increased neural activity rates, loss of correlation structure, and increased responses to cues. Ibogaine had surprisingly little effect on the size-frequency distribution of network activity events, suggesting that signal propagation within the retrosplenial cortex was largely unaffected.
Conclusions: Taken together, these data support proposals that compounds with psychedelic properties disrupt representations that are important for constraining neocortical activity, thereby increasing the entropy of neural signaling. Furthermore, the loss of expected position encoding between landmarks recapitulated effects of hippocampal impairment, suggesting that disruption of cognitive maps or other hippocampal processing may be a contributing mechanism of discoordinated neocortical activity in psychedelic states.","Acknowledgments and Disclosures This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (AJG, BLM, MM, JD), the New Frontiers Research Fund (AJG, JD), Alberta Innovates (MM), the Branch Out Neurological Foundation (VEI), the Beswick Fellowship (VEI), and the Canadian Institute of Health Research (BLM, MM).

Movement selection and motor learning, which are impaired early in HD, are regulated by connections between the motor cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus. In particular, plasticity at corticostriatal synapses, including endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (LTD), is critical for motor learning. Previously, we found impaired endocannabinoid-mediated LTD, induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS) at corticostriatal synapses in brain slice recordings from pre-manifest HD mouse models, which was corrected by JZL184, an inhibitor of endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) degradation.ObjectiveDetermine the effects of in vivo JZL184 administration on YAC128 HD model and wild-type (WT) littermate mice.MethodsJZL184 was administered to mice orally over a 3-week period and their motor function was assessed using several behavioral tasks. In addition, brain tissue was collected from mice in order to quantify changes in endocannabinoid levels and measure HFS-induced plasticity at corticostriatal synapses.ResultsOral administration of JZL184 significantly increased levels of 2-AG in striatal tissue. While JZL184 treatment had no impact on open field behavior, the treatment eliminated the difference in motor learning on the rotarod task between YAC128 and WT mice. Moreover, HFS-induced striatal plasticity in YAC128 mice was normalized to WT levels after JZL184 treatment.ConclusionsThese results suggest a novel target for mitigating early symptoms of HD and support the need for clinical trials of therapies that modulate the endocannabinoid system.","We are grateful to Lily Zhang for help with animal care and genotyping, as well as assistance with administration of peanut butter treatment.","Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by grants from the Huntington Society of Canada and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) PJT-178043 to LAR.

METHOD: The case was a 26-year-old male with a history of 10 concussions, diagnosed for bipolar type II disorder, mild attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a history of migraines/headaches. The case was medicated with Valproic Acid and Escitalopram. Sensor-based baseline data were collected within six months of his injury and on days 1-5, 10, and 14 post-injury. Symptom reporting, heart rate variability (HRV), neurovascular coupling (NVC), and dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) assessments were completed using numerous biomedical devices (i.e., transcranial Doppler ultrasound, 3-lead electrocardiography, finger photoplethysmography).
RESULTS: Total symptom and symptom severity scores were higher for the first-week post-injury, with physical and emotional symptoms being the most impacted. The NVC response showed lowered activation in the first three days post-injury, while autonomic (HRV) and autoregulation (dCA) were impaired across all testing visits occurring in the first 14 days following his concussion.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite symptom resolution, the case demonstrated ongoing autonomic and autoregulatory dysfunction. Larger samples examining individuals with an extensive history of concussion are warranted to understand the chronic physiological changes that occur following cumulative concussions through biosensing devices.",,This project was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC: RGPIN-2020-04057).

MIA has been consistently recognized as a major risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, and this association seems to be especially important for viral infections as viral exposure during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia. In MIA, the gestational parent's inflammatory response to an immune stimulus alters or interrupts fetal development, triggering neurodevelopmental consequences. As MIA can occur in any pregnancy, it is important to understand the many factors at play that contribute to altered brain development in the offspring, especially considering recent global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The underlying mechanisms by which MIA results in deleterious outcomes are not yet clear, but due to the inflammatory response it initiates, it is becoming apparent that microglia are critically involved. Through investigation of MIA animal models, the role of microglia in this field is becoming more evident. Compelling evidence from animal models indicates that MIA can disrupt synaptic pruning, neuronal progenitor cell proliferation/differentiation, oligodendrogenesis, and more. Microglia appear as an active player, assisting these neural-related functions during healthy development but also mediating MIA-induced disturbances in these critical processes when neurodevelopment is challenged. The present review illustrates this complex web by reviewing recent literature, focusing on the outcomes of MIA resulting from viral mimetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid in rodents, to provide a clear description of how MIA impacts microglial functions and what this means for the offspring's neurodevelopment. Moreover, we discuss the possible implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the neurodevelopment of the current and next generations in the frame of MIA models and propose some putative pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to prevent or attenuate MIA consequences.",,"M-.È.T. holds a Canada Research Chair (tier 2) in Neurobiology of Aging and Cognition, and this work was funded by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Project Grant (#461831) awarded to M-.È.T.

We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in adolescents and transitional aged youth with treatment resistant MDD. Methods: Thirty-two outpatients with moderate to severe, treatment-resistant MDD, aged 13-21 years underwent a three-week, open-label, single center trial of rTMS (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01731678). rTMS was applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using neuronavigation and administered for 15 consecutive week days (120% rest motor threshold; 40 pulses over 4 s [10 Hz]; inter-train interval, 26 s; 75 trains; 3,000 pulses). The primary outcome measure was change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D). Treatment response was defined as a >50% reduction in Ham-D scores. Safety and tolerability were also examined. Results: rTMS was effective in reducing MDD symptom severity (t = 8.94, df = 31, p < 0.00001). We observed 18 (56%) responders (≥ 50% reduction in Ham-D score) and 14 non-responders to rTMS. Fourteen subjects (44%) achieved remission (Ham-D score ≤ 7 post-rTMS). There were no serious adverse events (i.e., seizures). Mild to moderate, self-limiting headaches (19%) and mild neck pain (16%) were reported. Participants ranked rTMS as highly tolerable. The retention rate was 91% and compliance rate (completing all study events) was 99%. Conclusions: Our single center, open trial suggests that rTMS is a safe and effective treatment for youth with treatment resistant MDD. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed.

However, there is limited research demonstrating clinical validity and general reproducibility. To address this limitation, recording duration for adequate validity and within- and between-day reproducibility of prefrontal cortical oxygenation was evaluated. To assess validity, a reverse analysis of 10-min-long measurements (n = 52) at different recording durations (1-10-min) was quantified via coefficients of variation and Bland-Altman plots. To assess within- and between-day within-subject reproducibility, participants (n = 15) completed 2-min measurements twice a day (morning/afternoon) for five consecutive days. While 1-min recordings demonstrated sufficient validity for the assessment of oxygen saturation (StO2) and total hemoglobin concentration (THb), recordings ≥4 min revealed greater clinical utility for oxy- (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) concentration. Females had lower StO2, THb, HbO, and HHb values than males, but variability was approximately equal between sexes. Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.50-0.96. The minimal detectable change for StO2 was 1.15% (95% CI: 0.336-1.96%) and 3.12 µM for THb (95% CI: 0.915-5.33 µM) for females and 2.75% (95%CI: 0.807-4.70%) for StO2 and 5.51 µM (95%CI: 1.62-9.42 µM) for THb in males. Overall, FD-NIRS demonstrated good levels of between-day reliability. These findings support the application of FD-NIRS in field-based settings and indicate a recording duration of 1 min allows for valid measures; however, data recordings of ≥4 min are recommended when feasible.","The authors would like to thank all participants in this study for dedicating their time to this study.

Thus, we used PSG data to examine the: 1) association between OSA, and its severity, with IIH and 2) sex differences in OSA severity in those with and without IIH.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed diagnostic PSG data from January 2015 to August 2023 for patients who were diagnosed with IIH by a neuro-ophthalmologist using the modified Dandy criteria. We selected three age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) matched controls for each IIH patient. We examined potential associations of IIH with OSA using regression. Sex differences were analyzed using ANOVA.
RESULTS: Of 3482 patients who underwent PSG, we analyzed 78 IIH patients (16 males) and 234 matched controls (48 males). Five (6.4 %) IIH and 39 (16.7 %) control patients had OSA, defined as AHI≥15. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and comorbidities, IIH was negatively associated with the presence of OSA (OR 0.29, 95%CI 0.10-0.87, p = 0.03). However, models that adjusted for acetazolamide use, with or without comorbidities, showed no significant relationship with OSA (OR 0.31, p = 0.20). Males with IIH had a significantly higher age (p = 0.020), OSA severity (p = 0.032), and arousal index (p = 0.046) compared to females with IIH.
CONCLUSIONS: IIH treated with acetazolamide was not an independent risk factor for OSA presence or severity. The presence of IIH treated with acetazolamide likely does not warrant routine screening for OSA, but related risk factors may identify appropriate patients.","Declaration of competing interest Mark Boulos received consulting fees from Jazz pharmaceuticals, Paladin labs, and Eisai as well as medical equipment from Braebon and Interaxon.

2353,pub.1115972826,10.1111/psyp.13401,31144730,,Electrophysiological correlates of hyperoxia during resting‐state EEG in awake human subjects,"Recreational use of concentrated oxygen has increased. Claims have been made that hyperoxic breathing can help reduce fatigue, increase alertness, and improve attentional capacities; however, few systematic studies of these potential benefits exist. Here, we examined the effects of short-term (15 min) hyperoxia on resting states in awake human subjects by measuring spontaneous EEG activity between normoxic and hyperoxic situations, using a within-subject design for both eyes-opened and eyes-closed conditions. We also measured respiration rate, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation levels to correlate basic physiological changes due to the hyperoxic challenge with any brain activity changes. Our results show that breathing short-term 100% oxygen led to increased blood oxygen saturation levels, decreased heart rate, and a slight, but nonsignificant, decrease in breathing rate. Changes of brain activity were apparent, including decreases in low-alpha (7-10 Hz), high-alpha (10-14 Hz), beta (14-30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency ranges during eyes-opened hyperoxic conditions. During eyes-closed hyperoxia, increases in the delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and theta (3.5-7 Hz) frequency range were apparent together with decreases in the beta range. Hyperoxia appeared to accentuate the decrease of low alpha and gamma ranges across the eyes-opened and eyes-closed conditions, suggesting that it modulated brain state itself. As decreased alpha during eyes-opened conditions has been associated with increased attentional processing and selective attention, and increased delta and theta during eyes-closed condition are typically associated with the initiation of sleep, our results suggest a state-specific and perhaps opposing influence of short-term hyperoxia.","This work was supported by Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) discovery grants 2016‐06576 and 04792 to Drs.

The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) represents a crucial structure for the ability of endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling to modulate emotional behaviour, and receives dense projections from brainstem arousal system nuclei. We examined whether changes in emotional arousal state would influence the ability of acute eCB manipulations within the BLA to modulate anxiety. Rats were tested in an elevated plus maze (EPM) under low or high arousal conditions. The low emotional arousal group was extensively handled and habituated to the experimental room and tested under red light condition, the high emotional arousal group was not handled or habituated and tested under high light condition. We examined amygdalar eCB anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) levels immediately after the EPM and the effects of intra-BLA administration of the AEA hydrolysis inhibitor URB597 or the 2-AG hydrolysis inhibitor KML29 on anxiety behaviour. The modulation of anxiety-like behaviour by eCBs in the BLA was strictly dependent on the environmental-associated emotional arousal. Pharmacologically-induced elevations of AEA or 2-AG in the BLA decreased anxiety under conditions of low emotional arousal. Conversely, when the level of emotional arousal increased, local eCB manipulation was ineffective in the modulation of the emotional arousal-induced anxiety response. These findings suggest that, depending on the emotional arousal state, eCB system is differentially activated to regulate the anxiety response in the amygdala and help to understand the state-dependency of many interventions on anxiety.","AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR grant # FDN-143329) to M.N.H and by the Human Frontier Science Program to P.C.

Even subclinical OCD, which is 2-8 times more common than OCD in children, can engender considerable suffering, including social withdrawal, anxiety, depressed mood, and excess somatic complaints.1,2 It has been suggested that subclinical OCD symptoms during childhood may be precursors to developing the full disorder in adolescence and adulthood.

To address this, we tested the feasibility of novel rTMS techniques with cost-saving opportunities, such as an open-room setting, large non-focal parabolic coils, and custom-built coil arms. We employed a low-frequency (LF) 1 Hz stimulation protocol (360 pulses per session), delivered on the most affordable FDA-approved device. MDD participants received an initial accelerated rTMS course (arTMS) of 6 sessions/day over 5 days (30 total), followed by a tapering course of daily sessions (up to 25) to decrease the odds of relapse. The self-reported Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) was used to measure severity of depression. Forty-eight (48) patients completed the arTMS course. No serious adverse events occurred, and all patients reported manageable pain levels. Response and remission rates were 35.4% and 27.1% on the BDI-II, respectively, at the end of the tapering course. Repeated measures ANOVA showed significant changes of BDI-II scores over time. Even though our protocol will require further improvements, some of the concepts we introduced here could help guide the design of future trials aiming at increasing accessibility to rTMS.","JPM would like to thank the Brain Behavior Research Foundation and the Branch Out Neurological Foundation for their financial support of this project.

The projection pursuit regression approach has demonstrated that the upper frequency limit is ∼0.07 Hz, whereas another approach [transfer function analysis (TFA) phase approaching zero] indicated a theoretical upper frequency limit for the high-pass filter of 0.24 Hz. We investigated how these limits accurately represent the CA upper frequency limit, in addition to extending earlier findings with respect to biological sexes and across the cardiac cycle. Sixteen participants (nine females and seven males) performed repeated squat-stand manoeuvres at frequencies of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25 Hz, with insonation of the middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Linear regression modelling with adjustment for sex and order of squat completion was used to compared TFA gain and phase with 0.25 Hz (above the theoretical limit of CA). The upper frequency limit of CA with TFA gain was within the range of 0.05-0.10 Hz, whereas TFA phase was within the range of 0.20-0.25 Hz, and consistent between vessels, between sexes and across the cardiac cycle. Females displayed greater middle cerebral artery gain compared with males (all P < 0.047), and no phase differences were present (all P > 0.072). Although sex-specific differences were present for specific TFA metrics at a given frequency, the upper frequency limit of autoregulation was similar between cerebral conduit vessels, cardiac cycle phase and biological sex. Future work is warranted to determine whether an upper frequency limit exists with respect to hysteresis analyses.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank the participants for their willingness to be part of this study and perform the multitude of squat–stand cycles that were required to obtain the present data set.

The use of immune therapies to treat GBM has become a promising avenue of research. It was shown that amphotericin B (Amp B) can stimulate the innate immune system and suppress the growth of brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs). However, it is not feasible to use histopathology to determine immune activation in patients. We developed an MRI technique that can rapidly detect a therapeutic response in animals treated with drugs that stimulate innate immunity. Ultra-small iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIOs) are MRI contrast agents that have been widely used for cell tracking. We hypothesized that the increased monocyte infiltration into brain tumors due to Amp B can be detected using USPIO-MRI, providing an indicator of early drug response.
Methods: We implanted human BTICs into severe combined immunodeficient mice and allowed the tumor to establish before treating the animals with either Amp B or vehicle and then imaged them using MRI with USPIO (ferumoxytol) contrast.
Results: After 7 days of treatment, there was a significantly decreased T2* in the tumor of Amp B but not vehicle animals, suggesting that USPIO is carried into the tumor by monocytes. We validated our MRI results with histopathology and confirmed that Amp B-treated animals had significantly higher levels of macrophage/microglia that were colocalized with iron staining in their brain tumor compared with vehicle mice.

Recently, the eCB system has been highlighted as a potential novel target in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs).Objectives: Understanding how chronic substance use impacts the function of the eCB system can provide a mechanistic rationale for targeting this system in the treatment of SUDs.Methods: A comprehensive review of studies assessing concentrations of eCB ligands N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (anandamide; AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in individuals with a SUD diagnosis was performed using all EBSCO databases, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Methods and results related to eCB concentrations, diagnosis, and other factors (e.g. treatment status) were extracted from papers written in English and published in peer-reviewed journals before May 22, 2024.Results: Fifteen studies were reviewed; three in alcohol use disorder (AUD), three in cannabis use disorder (CUD), four in cocaine use disorder, one in opioid use disorder (OUD) and four across SUDs. Generally, AEA concentrations were usually, but not always, increased in AUD, CUD, OUD, and cocaine use disorder. 2-AG concentrations were measured less often but were increased in CUD and decreased in cocaine use disorder.Conclusions: Studies generally support the hypothesis that chronic substance use can impact eCB levels, most often with increased AEA and decreased (or not quantified) 2-AG concentrations, though results were often conflicting.

Females were tested in the early-follicular phase. The hypercapnia response was assessed using a rebreathing protocol (93% oxygen and 7% carbon dioxide) or dynamic end-tidal forcing as a cerebral blood velocity (CBv) change from 40 to 55-Torr. The hypocapnia response was quantified using a hyperventilation protocol as a CBv change from 40 to 25-Torr. Absolute and relative CVR slopes were compared across cardiac cycle phases, vessels, and biological sexes using analysis of covariance with Tukey post-hoc comparisons.ResultsNo differences were found between hypercapnia methods used (p > 0.050). Absolute hypercapnic slopes were highest in systole (p < 0.001), with no cardiac cycle differences for absolute hypocapnia (p > 0.050). Relative slopes were largest in diastole and smallest in systole for both hypercapnia and hypocapnia (p < 0.001). Females exhibited greater absolute CVR responses (p < 0.050), while only the relative systolic hypercapnic response was different between sexes (p = 0.001). Absolute differences were present between the MCA and PCA (p < 0.001), which vanished when normalizing data to baseline values (p > 0.050).ConclusionCardiac cycle variations impact CVR responses, with females displaying greater absolute CVR in some cardiac phases during the follicular window. These findings are likely due to sex differences in endothelial receptors/signalling pathways.

Currently, limited research exists regarding how different exercise modalities and postural changes impact the cerebrovasculature across the cardiac cycle. Ten participants (4 females and 6 males) ages 20-29 completed three exercise tests (treadmill, supine, and upright cycling) to volitional fatigue. Physiological data collected included middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv), blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and respiratory parameters. Normalized data were analyzed for variance and effect sizes were calculated to examine differences between physiological measures across the three exercise modalities. Systolic MCAv was greater during treadmill compared to supine and upright cycling (p < 0.001, (large) effect size), and greater during upright versus supine cycling (p < 0.017, (large)). Diastolic MCAv was lower during treadmill versus cycling exercise only at 60% maximal effort (p < 0.005, (moderate)) and no differences were observed between upright and supine cycling. No main effect was found for mean and diastolic BP (p > 0.05, (negligible)). Systolic BP was lower during treadmill versus supine cycling at 40% and 60% intensity (p < 0.05, (moderate-large)) and greater during supine versus upright at only 60% intensity (p < 0.003, (moderate)). The above differences were not explained by partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide levels (main effect: p = 0.432). The current study demonstrates the cerebrovascular and cardiovascular systems respond heterogeneously to different exercise modalities and aspects of the cardiac cycle. As physiological data were largely similar between tests, differences associated with posture and modality are likely contributors.",,"The work in this manuscript was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC: RGPIN-2020-04057 and CGSD3-559333-2021), University of Calgary, Brain Canada Foundation (Brain Canada), Brain Changes Initiative (BCI), and Branch Out Neurological Foundation.",Applied Physiology Nutrition and Metabolism,,,"Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Young Adult; Posture; Blood Pressure; Heart Rate; Exercise; Exercise Test; Middle Cerebral Artery; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial; Blood Flow Velocity; Bicycling; Supine Position",2024-08-01,2024,2024-08-01,2024-11-01,49,11,1539-1550,Closed,Article,"Burkart, Joshua J.; Johnson, Nathan E.; Burma, Joel S.; Neill, Matthew G.; Smirl, Jonathan D.","Burkart, Joshua J.

In this review, we first offer an historical perspective, followed by a review of basic principles, such as putative mechanisms, procedures and protocols, stimulation targets, efficacy and durability of response, side effects, and the placebo controversy. In the second part of this review, we first discuss solutions to increase accessibility to rTMS, such as modifications to treatment equipment, protocols and setting.

This evidence is heavily based on the use of ζ inhibitory peptide (ZIP), a supposed specific inhibitor of PKMζ that interferes with both LTP and LTM. Problematically, both LTP and LTM are unaffected in both constitutive and conditional PKMζ knock-out mice, yet both are still impaired by ZIP application, suggesting a nonspecific mechanism of action. Because translational interference can disrupt neural activity, we assessed network activity after a unilateral intrahippocampal infusion of ZIP in anesthetized rats. ZIP profoundly reduced spontaneous hippocampal local field potentials, comparable in magnitude to infusions of lidocaine, but with a slower onset and longer duration. Our results highlight a serious confound in interpreting the behavioral effects of ZIP. We suggest that future molecular approaches in neuroscience consider the intervening level of cellular and systems neurophysiology before claiming influences on behavior.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Long-term memory in the brain is thought to arise from a sustained molecular process that can maintain changes in synaptic plasticity. A so-called candidate for the title of ""the memory molecule"" is protein kinase M ζ (PKMζ), mainly because its inhibition by ζ inhibitory peptide (ZIP) interferes with previously established synaptic plasticity and memory. We show that brain applications of ZIP that can impair memory actually profoundly suppress spontaneous brain activity directly or can cause abnormal seizure activity. We suggest that normal brain activity occurring after learning may be a more primary element of memory permanence.",,"This work was supported by the Natural Science and Engineering council of Canada (NSERC Grant 249861 to C.T.D.).

METHOD: Ten children with Tourette syndrome (eight males, two females; 9-15y) participated in this open-label, phase 1 clinical trial. Treatment consisted of 1800 low-frequency (1Hz) neuronavigated robotic rTMS (100% resting motor threshold) to the SMA, bilaterally for 15 sessions. The primary outcome was a change in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) total score from baseline to posttreatment. Secondary outcome measures included changes in magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite concentrations, TMS neurophysiology measures, TMS motor maps, and clinical assessments (anxiety, depression) from baseline to the end of treatment.
RESULTS: The YGTSS score decreased from baseline after treatment (p<0.001; Cohen's d=2.9). All procedures were well-tolerated.
INTERPRETATION: Robot-driven, neuronavigated bilateral rTMS of the SMA is feasible in children with Tourette syndrome and appears to reduce tic severity.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can be subverted by the cancer to adopt a pro-tumor phenotype to aid tumor growth. These anti-inflammatory, pro-tumor TAMs have been shown to contribute to a worsened outcome in several different types of cancer. Various strategies aimed at combating the pro-tumor TAMs have been developed. Several therapies, such as oncolytic viral therapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound, have been shown to stimulate TAMs and suppress tumor growth. Targeting TAMs is a promising way to combat cancer, but sensitive imaging methods that are capable of detecting these therapeutic responses are needed. A promising idea is to use imaging contrast agents to label TAMs to determine their relative number and location within, and around the tumor. This can provide information about the efficacy of TAM depletion therapies, as well as macrophage-stimulating therapies. In this review, we describe various in vivo MRI methods capable of tracking TAMs, and conclude with a short section on tracking TAMs in patients.",,"Funding: This work is supported by a Brain Canada Platform Grant (J.F.D.), Alberta Innovates Health Solutions—Alberta Cancer Foundation Collaborative Research and Innovative Opportunities grant (R.Y., S.S., V.W.Y., J.F.D.), Alberta Innovates Health Solutions MD-PhD Studentship (R.Y.), and Branch Out Neurological Foundations Graduate Studentship (R.Y.)",Magnetic Resonance Insights,,,,2018-01-01,2018,2018-04-26,2018-01-01,11,,1178623x18771974,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yang, Runze; Sarkar, Susobhan; Yong, V Wee; Dunn, Jeff F","Yang, Runze (Department of Radiology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada); Sarkar, Susobhan (Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada); Yong, V Wee (Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada); Dunn, Jeff F (Department of Radiology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada)","Dunn, Jeff F (University of Calgary; University of Calgary; University of Calgary)","Yang, Runze (University of Calgary; University of Calgary; University of Calgary); Sarkar, Susobhan (University of Calgary; University of Calgary); Yong, V Wee (University of Calgary; University of Calgary; University of Calgary); Dunn, Jeff F (University of Calgary; University of Calgary; University of Calgary)",28,6,0.89,4.5,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1178623X18771974,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103696462,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Therefore, in this study we investigated the safety and neuroprotective efficacy of the CARPs poly-arginine-18 (R18; 18-mer of arginine) and its D-enantiomer R18D given in the acute bleeding phase in an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) model.
METHODS: One hundred and fifty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats received collagenase-induced ICH. Study 1 examined various doses of R18D (30, 100, 300, or 1000 nmol/kg) or R18 (100, 300, 1000 nmol/kg) administered intravenously 30 minutes post-collagenase injection on hemorrhage volume 24 hours after ICH. Study 2 examined R18D (single intravenous dose) or R18 (single intravenous dose, plus 6 daily intraperitoneal doses) at 300 or 1000 nmol/kg commencing 30 minutes post-collagenase injection on behavioural outcomes (Montoya staircase test, and horizontal ladder test) in the chronic post-ICH period. A histological assessment of tissue loss was assessed using a Nissl stain at 28 days after ICH.
RESULTS: When administered during ongoing bleeding, neither R18 or R18D exacerbated hematoma volume or worsened functional deficits. Lesion volume assessment at 28 days post-ICH was not reduced by the peptides; however, animals treated with the lower R18D 300 nmol/kg dose, but not with the higher 1000 nmol/kg dose, demonstrated a statistically increased lesion size compared to saline treated animals.
CONCLUSION: Overall, both R18 and R18D appeared to be safe when administered during a period of ongoing bleeding following ICH. Neither peptide appears to have any statistically significant effect in reducing lesion volume or improving functional recovery after ICH. Additional studies are required to further assess dose efficacy and safety in pre-clinical ICH studies.","FC is supported by a Canada Research Chair award (http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/ homeaccueil-eng.aspx).

This study compared the use of two different haptic tools (rigid railing and haptic anchors) and investigated whether any effects on walking were the result of the added sensory input and/or the posture generated when using those tools. Data from 28 young healthy adults were collected using the Mobility Lab inertial sensor system (APDM, Oregon, USA). Participants walked with and without both haptic tools and while pretending to use both haptic tools (placebo trials), with eyes opened and eyes closed. Using the tools or pretending to use both tools decreased normalized stride velocity (p < .001–0.008) and peak medial–lateral (ML) trunk velocity (p < .001–0.001). Normalized stride velocity was slower when actually using the railing compared to placebo railing trials (p = .006). Using the anchors resulted in lower peak ML trunk velocity than the railing (p = .002). The anchors had lower peak ML trunk velocity than placebo anchors (p < .001), but there was no difference between railing and placebo railing (p > .999). These findings highlight a difference in the type of tool used to add haptic input and suggest that changes in balance control strategy resulting from using the railing are based on arm placement, where it is the posture combined with added sensory input that affects balance control strategies with the haptic anchors. These findings provide a strong framework for additional research to be conducted on the effects of haptic input on walking in populations known to have decreased walking balance.",,,Experimental Brain Research,,,Adolescent; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Humans; Male; Postural Balance; Touch Perception; Walking; Young Adult,2017-03-10,2017,2017-03-10,2017-06,235,6,1731-1739,Closed,Article,"Hedayat, Isabel; Moraes, Renato; Lanovaz, Joel L.; Oates, Alison R.","Hedayat, Isabel (College of Kinesiology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada); Moraes, Renato (School of Physical Education and Sport of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil); Lanovaz, Joel L.

It involves applying an electrical current to muscles and/or peripheral nerves to facilitate functional movements, such as walking and reaching. Despite the potential therapeutic benefits of FES, and the considerable investment into its research and development, FES is not widely used in clinical practice.
AREAS COVERED: In this narrative review, we examine this research-to-practice gap. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched using keywords related to the population, constructs and context of interest. We provide an orientation to SCI and summarize how FES may facilitate motor recovery. Using the Knowledge-to-Action Framework as a guide, we demonstrate how co-design and implementation strategies can be incorporated into FES device development and research to aid clinical translation in SCI rehabilitation. Based on prior literature, we provide recommendations for researchers and technology developers: 1) collaborate with implementation scientists, 2) adopt participatory methods, 3) use a knowledge translation framework as a guide, 4) thoroughly understand implementation barriers and facilitators, and 5) budget time for implementation.
EXPERT OPINION: Greater focus on clinical implementation is needed in the FES research field to address the current research-to-practice gap.",,"This manuscript was funded by the Paralyzed Veterans of America Education Foundation under grant G_PVA_EDU_GAF_00037 to KEM, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research under grants [PCS-185510 and 201910CPG] to KEM, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada under grant [CHRPJ 549680–20] to KEM, and Campus Alberta Neuroscience, the Alberta Paraplegic Foundation and the University of Alberta to HJ-R.

Here, we describe a platform for spatially resolved, single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics, called tDISCO (tissue-digital microfluidic isolation of single cells for -Omics). We use tDISCO alongside two high-throughput platforms for spatial (Visium) and single-cell transcriptomics (10X Chromium) to examine the heterogeneity of the astrocyte response to a cortical ischemic stroke in male mice. We show that integration of Visium and 10X Chromium datasets infers two astrocyte populations, proximal or distal to the injury site, while tDISCO determines the spatial boundaries and molecular profiles that define these populations. We find that proximal astrocytes show differences in lipid shuttling, with enriched expression of Apoe and Fabp5. Our datasets provide a resource for understanding the roles of astrocytes in stroke and showcase the utility of tDISCO for hypothesis-driven, spatially resolved single-cell experiments.","The authors acknowledge the Princess Margaret Genomics Center, the Donnelly Sequencing Center and Lisa Lock from Illumina.

While these systems work against one another with respect to arousal, chronic stress-induced downregulation of both systems often leads to anhedonia or the inability to experience pleasure from natural rewards. In the current study, a 24 h restraint stress test (24 h RST) reduced sucrose preference in adult male and female C57BL/6 mice. Prior to the stressor, subsets of mice were intraperitoneally administered cannabinoid and orexin receptor agonists, antagonists, and combinations of these drugs. Restraint mice that received the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) antagonist SR141716A, orexin receptor type 2 (OX2R) agonist YNT-185, and the combination of SR141716A and YNT-185, exhibited less anhedonia compared to vehicle/control mice. Thus, the 24 h RST likely decreased orexin signaling, which was then restored by YNT-185. Receptor colocalization analysis throughout mesocorticolimbic brain regions revealed increased CB1R-OX1R colocalization from SR141716A and YNT-185 treatments. Although a previous study from our group showed additive cataleptic effects between CP55,940 and the dual orexin receptor antagonist (TCS-1102), the opposite combination of pharmacological agents proved additive for sucrose preference. Taken together, these results reveal more of the complex interactions between the endocannabinoid and orexin systems.",,"This work was funded by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Grant (DGECR-2019-00207) held by Robert Laprairie.

Reliability of resting maps is well established, but understudied for active maps and unestablished for active maps obtained using robotic TMS techniques. The objective of  this study was to determine the reliability of robotic neuro-navigated TMS motor map measures during active muscle contraction. We hypothesized that map area and volume would show excellent short- and medium-term reliability. Twenty healthy adults were tested on 3 days. Active maps of the first dorsal interosseous muscle were created using a 12 × 12 grid (7 mm spacing). Short- (24 h) and medium-term (3–5 weeks) relative (intra-class correlation coefficient) and absolute (minimal detectable change (MDC); standard error of measure) reliabilities were evaluated for map area, volume, center of gravity (CoG), and hotspot magnitude (peak-to-peak MEP amplitude at the hotspot), along with active motor threshold (AMT) and maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). This study found that AMT and MVC had good-to-excellent short- and medium-term reliability. Map CoG (x and y) were the most reliable map measures across sessions with excellent short- and medium-term reliability (p < 0.001). Map area, hotspot magnitude, and map volume followed with better reliability medium-term than short-term, with a change of 28%, 62%, and 78% needed to detect a true medium-term change, respectively. Therefore, robot-guided neuro-navigated TMS active mapping is relatively reliable but varies across measures. This, and MDC, should be considered in interventional study designs.",,"This work was supported by the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR), the Branch Out Neurological Foundation (BONF), and support for the Scientific Director of the Strategic Clinical Network for Addictions and Mental Health from Alberta Health Services.",Experimental Brain Research,,,"Adult; Humans; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Robotics; Reproducibility of Results; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Brain Mapping; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Motor Cortex; Muscle, Skeletal; Electromyography",2022-12-16,2022,2022-12-16,2023-02,241,2,355-364,Closed,Article,"Kahl, Cynthia K.; Giuffre, Adrianna; Wrightson, James G.; Zewdie, Ephrem; Condliffe, Elizabeth G.; MacMaster, Frank P.; Kirton, Adam","Kahl, Cynthia K.

2077,pub.1104345538,10.1111/epi.14440,29858515,,Comorbid epilepsy in autism spectrum disorder: Implications of postnatal inflammation for brain excitability,"OBJECTIVE: In different cohorts, 5%-30% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) also have epilepsy. The high co-occurrence of these disorders suggests that a common mechanistic link may exist. The underlying pathophysiology of this comorbidity remains unknown. To investigate the mechanism(s) involved in the pathogenesis of ASD and epilepsy, we developed and validated a novel mouse model that concurrently exhibits hallmark features of both disorders.
METHODS: We utilized inbred BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice that exhibit the core behavioral characteristics of ASD (ie, impaired sociability, altered vocalizations, and restricted interests). BTBR mice received a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or sterile saline injection at postnatal day (P)7, P14, or P21. Cytokine expression was analyzed for interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α in brain tissue of P7 and adult BTBR mice. Adult BTBR mice were behaviorally analyzed for seizure susceptibility, sociability, communication deficits, and motor stereotypies, and monitored using chronic video-electroencephalography (EEG).
RESULTS: Adult male and female BTBR mice treated at P7-P14 with LPS were more sensitive to pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures than saline-treated controls. ASD-like behaviors and hippocampal cytokine levels were unchanged between P7 LPS-treated BTBR mice and controls. EEG recordings from the dorsal hippocampus revealed a significant increase in number and frequency of seizures over the 4-week recording period (P60-P88) in BTBR mice postnatally treated with LPS at P7. These results indicate the presence of a comorbid epileptic phenotype in BTBR mice.
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that an early postnatal immune challenge can increase brain excitability in adult BTBR mice and reveal an underlying epilepsy phenotype. This novel animal model may enable the elucidation of specific molecular alterations that are associated with the concurrent presentation of ASD and epilepsy, which could facilitate the development of targeted therapies for individuals affected by this comorbidity.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by research grants from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to Q.J.P., research grants to J.M.R. from CIHR, and the Pediatric Brain Injury Research Program, funded by Alberta Children&#x27;s Hospital Foundation.

This view stems from the observation that protein synthesis inhibitors, such as anisomycin (ANI), administered during this consolidation period cause memory impairments. However, in addition to blocking protein synthesis, intrahippocampal infusions of ANI cause the suppression of evoked and spontaneous neural activity, suggesting that ANI could impair memory expression by simply preventing activity-dependent brain functions. Here, we evaluated the influence of intrahippocampal ANI infusions on allocentric spatial navigation using the Morris water maze, a task well known to require dorsal hippocampal integrity. Young, adult male Sprague Dawley rats were implanted with bilateral dorsal hippocampal cannulae, and their ability to learn the location of a hidden platform was assessed before and following infusions of ANI, TTX, or vehicle (PBS). Before infusion, all groups demonstrated normal spatial navigation (training on days 1 and 2), whereas 30 min following infusions (day 3) both the ANI and TTX groups showed significant impairments in allocentric navigation, but not visually cued navigation, when compared with PBS-treated animals. Spatial navigational deficits appeared to resolve on day 4 in the ANI and TTX groups, 24 h following infusion. These results show that ANI and TTX inhibit the on-line function of the dorsal hippocampus in a similar fashion and highlight the importance of neural activity as an intervening factor between molecular and behavioral processes.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The permanence of memories has long thought to be mediated by the production of new proteins, because protein synthesis inhibitors can block retrieval of recently learned information. However, protein synthesis inhibitors may have additional detrimental effects on neurobiological function. Here we show that anisomycin, a commonly used protein synthesis inhibitor in memory research, impairs on-line brain function in a way similar to an agent that eliminates electrical neural activity. Since disruption of neural activity can also lead to memory loss, it may be that memory permanence is mediated by neural rehearsal following learning.",,"This work was supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Council of Canada grants 249861 to C.T.D. and 38726 to D.T., J.D.D. was supported by a Branch Out Neurological Foundation Student Summership.

One of the hallmark symptoms of PTSD is an alteration in the ability to extinguish fear responses to trauma-associated cues. In male rodents, the endocannabinoid system can modulate fear extinction and has been suggested as a therapeutic target for PTSD. However, whether and how the endocannabinoid system may modulate fear expression and extinction in females remains unknown.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: To answer this question, we pharmacologically manipulated endocannabinoid signalling in male and female rats prior to extinction of auditory conditioned fear and measured both passive (freezing) and active (darting) conditioned responses.
KEY RESULTS: Surprisingly, we found that acute systemic inhibition of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) or 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) hydrolysis did not significantly alter fear expression or extinction in males. However, the same manipulations in females produced diverging effects. Increased AEA signalling at vanilloid TRPV1 receptors impaired fear memory extinction. In contrast, inhibition of 2-AG hydrolysis promoted active over passive fear responses acutely via activation of cannabinoid1 (CB1 ) receptors. Measurement of AEA and 2-AG levels after extinction training revealed sex- and brain region-specific changes.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: We provide the first evidence that AEA and 2-AG signalling affect fear expression and extinction in females in opposite directions. These findings are relevant to future research on sex differences in mechanisms of fear extinction and may help develop sex-specific therapeutics to treat trauma-related disorders.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Min Qiao for technical assistance.

This scoping review aims to determine the nature and extent of the literature, and key characteristics, of online mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for adults with physical or mental health conditions.
DESIGN: A scoping review guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute framework.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies focusing on online MBIs, online mindfulness-based stress reduction and online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in adults with a physical or mental health condition were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Study and participant characteristics, key intervention characteristics, outcome measures and results were abstracted.
RESULTS: 84 studies were included. Online MBIs have been studied in many different physical and mental health conditions; however, 63 of the included studies were for physical health conditions. MBCT was the most common intervention type assessed, with 33 of the included studies assessing it. Regarding intervention characteristics, intervention duration was similar across intervention type at 8 weeks, with sessions led by therapists, clinicians or mindfulness instructors. Web-based and videoconferencing were the most common delivery formats. Intervention content generally remained similar to standardised MBIs, with the addition of psychoeducation and disease management. Many studies did not report on tailoring the intervention to the participant population. There was a lack of consistency in reporting intervention characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights some evidence for online mindfulness programmes for both physical and mental health conditions. However, intervention componentry remains somewhat obscure, and reporting on tailoring appears relatively sparse. Greater consistency in reporting intervention componentry will improve knowledge and study in this area and enhance the translation of these interventions to clinical settings.",,"This work was supported by the Craig H.

The two endocannabinoid ligands, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), both play roles in regulating the stress response and both exhibit dynamic changes in response to stress exposure. Most of this previous research, however, was conducted in male rodents. Given that, especially in rodents, the stress response is influenced by sex, an understanding of how these dynamic responses of endocannabinoids in response to stress is influenced by sex could provide insight into sex differences of the acute stress response. We exposed adult, Sprague Dawley rats to different commonly utilized acute stress modalities, specifically restraint, swim and foot shock stress. Thirty minutes following stress onset, we excised the amygdala, hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, corticolimbic brain regions involved in the stress response, to measure endocannabinoid levels. When AEA levels were altered in response to restraint and swim stress, they were reduced, whereas exposure to foot shock stress led to an increase in the amygdala. 2-AG levels, when they were altered by stress exposure were only increased, specifically in males in the amygdala following swim stress, and in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex overall following foot shock stress. This increase in 2-AG levels following stress only in males was the only sex difference found in stress-induced changes in endocannabinoid levels. There were no consistent sex differences observed. Collectively, these data contribute to our further understanding of the interactions between stress and endocannabinoid function.","This manuscript is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Bruce McEwen.

METHODS: About 26 children with ADHD and 24 typically developing children (TDC; 7‒16 years) underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and completed an EF assessment battery.
RESULTS: Significantly thinner right-SFG in the ADHD group was found compared to the TDC group (t (48) = 2.81, p = .007, Cohen's d = 0.84). Linear regression models showed that 12.5% of inattention, 13.6% of hyperactivity, and 9.0% of EF variance was accounted for by the right-SFG thickness.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the right-SFG thickness were found in our ADHD group and were associated with parent ratings of inattentive and hyperactive symptoms as well with EF ratings. These results replicate previous findings of thinner right-SFG and are consistent with the delayed cortical maturation theory of ADHD.","The authors would like to thank Kristina Lynberg for her work with data collection, Quinn McLellan for helping with Free Surfer analysis, and Linda Beatty and Clara Wang for secretarial support.","Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by funding from the Alberta Children’s Hospital Foundation, the Werklund School of Education (University of Calgary), support for the Scientific Director of the Strategic Clinical Network for Addictions and Mental Health from Alberta Health Services, Branch Out Neurological Foundation, and the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR).",Journal of Attention Disorders,,,Child; Humans; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Prefrontal Cortex; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Gyrus Cinguli; Executive Function,2022-07-11,2022,2022-07-11,2022-12,26,14,1895-1906,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Hai, Tasmia; Swansburg, Rose; Kahl, Cynthia K.; Frank, Hannah; Stone, Kayla; Lemay, Jean-François; MacMaster, Frank P.","Hai, Tasmia (University of Calgary, AB, Canada; University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada); Swansburg, Rose (University of Calgary, AB, Canada); Kahl, Cynthia K.

We explored differences in neurometabolite levels and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-derived corticomotor representations among children with ADHD and typically developing children.
METHODS: We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocols to measure excitatory (glutamate + glutamine [Glx]) and inhibitory (γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) neurometabolite levels in the dominant primary motor cortex (M1) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) in children with ADHD and typically developing children. We used robotic neuronavigated TMS to measure corticospinal excitability and create corticomotor maps.
RESULTS: We collected data from 26 medication-free children with ADHD (aged 7-16 years) and 25 typically developing children (11-16 years). Children with ADHD had lower M1 Glx (p = 0.044, d = 0.6); their mean resting motor threshold was lower (p = 0.029, d = 0.8); their map area was smaller (p = 0.044, d = 0.7); and their hotspot density was higher (p = 0.008, d = 0.9). M1 GABA levels were associated with motor map area (p = 0.036).Limitations: Some TMS data were lost because the threshold of some children exceeded 100% of the machine output. The relatively large MRS voxel required to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and reliably measure GABA levels encompassed tissue beyond the M1, making this measure less anatomically specific.
CONCLUSION: The neurochemistry and neurophysiology of key nodes in the motor network may be altered in children with ADHD, and the differences appear to be related to each other. These findings suggest potentially novel neuropharmacological and neuromodulatory targets for ADHD.","The authors would like to thank Dr. Elizabeth G.

This study will determine the efficacy and safety of paired comprehensive behavioural intervention for tics (CBIT) plus repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment in children with Tourette's syndrome. We hypothesise that CBIT and active rTMS to the supplementary motor area (SMA) will (1) decrease tic severity, and (2) be associated with changes indicative of enhanced neuroplasticity (eg, changes in in vivo metabolite concentrations and TMS neurophysiology measures).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will recruit 50 youth with TS, aged 6-18 for a phase II, double-blind, block randomised, sham-controlled trial comparing active rTMS plus CBIT to sham rTMS plus CBIT in a 1:1 ratio. The CBIT protocol is eight sessions over 10 weeks, once a week for 6 weeks and then biweekly. The rTMS protocol is 20 sessions of functional MRI-guided, low-frequency (1 Hz) rTMS targeted to the bilateral SMA over 5 weeks (weeks 2-6). MRI, clinical and motor assessments and neurophysiological evaluations including motor mapping will be performed 1 week before CBIT start, 1 week after rTMS treatment and 1 week after CBIT completion. The primary outcome measure is Tourette's symptom change from baseline to post-CBIT treatment, as measured by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale. Secondary outcomes include changes in imaging, neurophysiological and behavioural markers.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (REB18-0220). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, on ClinicalTrials.gov and shared with the Tourette and OCD Alberta Network. The results will also be disseminated through the Alberta Addictions and Mental Health Research Hub.

To investigate if iron accumulation in AD is more likely due to pathological iron-rich compartments, or a compensatory response of iron within oligodendrocytes to disease progression, we sought to quantify iron-rich staining (via Perl's diaminobenzidine; DAB). Healthy wild-type (WT) and APPSwe-PS1Δe9 (APP-PS1; amyloid-beta overexpressing) male mice were examined during middle age, at 14 months. The frontal cortex, a brain region affected over the course of dementia progression, was investigated. Iron-rich compartments were found across genotypes, including oligodendrocytes and immune cells at the blood-brain barrier, and exclusively amyloid plaques in the APP-PS1 genotype. A semi-automated approach was employed to quantify the staining intensity of iron-rich compartments with light microscopy. Mouse frontal cortex of each genotype was also assessed qualitatively and ultrastructurally with scanning electron microscopy, to novelly discern and confirm iron-rich staining (via Perl's DAB). We found parenchymal iron staining corresponding to oligodendrocytes, pericytes, astrocytes, microglia and/or infiltrating macrophages, and amyloid plaques; increased iron deposition and clustering were detected in middle-aged male APP-PS1 versus WT frontal cortex, supporting that AD pathology may involve greater brain iron levels and local clustering. Unexpectedly, iron-rich cells were enriched at the central nervous system (CNS) interface and perivascular space in control and APP-PS1 mouse models, with ultrastructural examination revealing examples of these cells loaded with many secretory granules containing iron. Together, our results provide novel exploration and confirmation of iron-rich cells/compartments in scanning electron microscopy and reinforce literature that iron deposition is relatively increased in AD over healthy cognitive aging and involves greater local clusters of iron burden. Increased iron burden along the aging trajectory, regardless of cognitive status, may also be attributed to novelly discovered iron-rich cells secreting granules along the CNS border.","Acknowledgments As part of the University of Victoria, we acknowledge and respect the lək̓ wəŋən peoples on whose traditional territory the university stands and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and W̱ SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

However, the use of preventative antithrombotic therapy can increase the risk of ICH recurrence and worsen ICH-related outcomes. Colchicine, an anti-inflammatory agent, has the potential to mitigate inflammation-related atherothrombosis and reduce the risk of ischemic vascular events. Here we investigated the safety and efficacy of colchicine when used both before and acutely after ICH. We predicted that daily colchicine administration would not impact our safety measures but would reduce brain injury and improve functional outcomes associated with inflammation reduction. To test this, 0.05 mg/kg colchicine was given orally once daily to rats either before or after they were given a collagenase-induced striatal ICH. We assessed neurological impairments, intra-parenchymal bleeding, Perls positive cells, and brain injury to gauge the therapeutic impact of colchicine on brain injury. Colchicine did not significantly affect bleeding (average = 40.7 μL) at 48 hrs, lesion volume (average = 24.5 mm3) at 14 days, or functional outcome (median neurological deficit scale score at 2 days post-ICH = 4, i.e., modest deficits) from 1-14 days after ICH. Colchicine reduced the volume of Perls positive cells in the perihematomal zone, indicating a reduction in inflammation. Safety measures (body weight, food consumption, water consumption, hydration, body temperature, activity, and pain) were not affected by colchicine. Although colchicine did not confer neuroprotection or functional benefit, it was able to reduce perihematomal inflammation after ICH without increasing bleeding. Thus, our findings suggest that colchicine treatment is safe, unlikely to worsen bleeding, and is unlikely but may reduce secondary injury after an ICH if initiated early post ICH to reduce the risk of ischemic vascular events. These results are informative for the ongoing CoVasc-ICH phase II randomized trial (NCT05159219).",We would like to thank Anna Kalisvaart and Sherry Gu for their help with this experiment.,"CMW is supported by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research scholarship and a Killam trust scholarship.

Chronic variable stress prior to conception impairs offspring development in terms of behavior, neuroanatomy, and neurobiology. Previously, our lab demonstrated that even a consistent stressor experienced by the sire or the dam shapes offspring development beginning in early life. Here, we show how consistent maternal stress prior to conception influences the brain and behavior of offspring in adolescence and adulthood. Female Long-Evans rats were exposed to elevated platform stress twice daily for 27 consecutive days immediately prior to mating with non-stressed males. Male and female offspring were assessed in the open field and elevated plus maze in adolescence, and open field, elevated plus maze, Whishaw tray reaching, and Morris water task in adulthood. Offspring were then euthanized, and their brains were stained with Golgi-Cox solution and then examined for dendritic spine density and hippocampal volume. Major findings include deficits in spatial memory, decreased medial prefrontal cortex spine density, and reduced right dorsal hippocampal volume in male offspring only. This work illustrates that the effects of consistent maternal stress prior to conception are lifelong and highly sexually dimorphic.",The authors would like to acknowledge Animal Care Services at the University of Lethbridge for their essential role in animal husbandry.,This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council to R.G.

A cross-sectional cohort study of 120 participants aged 60-85 years old (48 females) were recruited (69 PD and 51 healthy controls). Assessments included demographic information, neuropsychological tests, a motor evaluation, neuropsychiatric questionnaires, and the Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire. A history of TBI or number of TBIs was not significantly related to an increased risk of developing PD or poorer motor scores on the United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part 3. There was a significant negative correlation between number of TBI's and mean z-scores of global cognition (rs(69) = -0.338, p = 0.004), executive function (rs(69) = -0.251, p = 0.038), memory (rs(69) = -0.262, p = 0.029), and language (rs(69) = -0.245, p = 0.042), and a significant positive correlation on the Beck Depression Inventory II (rs(69) = 0.285, p = 0.018) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (rs(69) = 0.326, p = 0.006) in the PD group only. In conclusion, a history of TBI was negatively associated with cognition and positively associated with depressive symptoms in patients with PD, but not with motor symptoms.","We would like to acknowledge Dr Wayne Gordon and his team at the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine in the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai for allowing us to use Part I of the BISQ.

Recently it has been realized that dopamine (DA) projections from the substantia nigra pars compacta project to the MLR. Here we explore DA projections from an area of the medial zona incerta (ZI) known for its role in motor control onto the MLR. We provide evidence that dopaminergic (DAergic) A13 neurons have connectivity to the cuneiform nucleus (CnF) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) of the MLR. No ascending connectivity to the dorsolateral striatum was observed. On the other hand, DAergic A13 projections to the medullary reticular formation (MRF) and the lumbar spinal cord were sparse. A small number of non-DAergic neurons within the medial ZI projected to the lumbar spinal cord. We then characterized the DA A13 cells and report that these cells differ from canonical DA neurons since they lack the Dopamine Transporter (DAT). The lack of DAT expression, and possibly the lack of a dopamine reuptake mechanism, points to a longer time of action compared to typical dopamine neurons. Collectively our data suggest a parallel descending DAergic pathway from the A13 neurons of the medial ZI to the MLR, which we expect is important for modulating movement.",We would like to acknowledge Jillian Ejdrygiewicz and Claude Veillette for their technical assistance during the completion of this work.

While the neural substrates underlying working memory capacity have been studied in humans, considerably less is known about the circuitry mediating working memory capacity in rodents. Therefore, the present experiments tested the involvement of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal striatum (STR) in the odor span task (OST), a task proposed to assay working memory capacity in rodents. Initially, Long Evans rats were trained to dig in scented sand for food following a serial delayed nonmatching-to-sample rule. Temporary inactivation of dorsomedial (dm) STR significantly reduced span in well trained rats. Inactivation of mPFC or contralateral disconnection of the mPFC and dmSTR also reduced span. Infusing the GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor antagonist Ro 25-6981 into mPFC did not affect span; however, span was significantly reduced following bilateral Ro 25-6981 infusions into dmSTR or contralateral disconnection of mPFC (inactivation) and dmSTR (Ro 25-6981). These results suggest that span capacity in rats depends on GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor-dependent interactions between the mPFC and the dmSTR. Therefore, interventions targeting this circuit may improve the working memory capacity impairments in patients with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.",This work was supported by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Operating Grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research to J.G.H.

This respiratory entrainment has been suggested to occur more broadly during slow-wave states (including sleep) throughout the forebrain, in particular in the frontal and parahippocampal and hippocampal cortices. Using multisite local field potential recording methods and spectral coherence analysis in the rat, we show here that no such broad forebrain coupling takes place during slow-wave activity patterns under either ketamine-xylazine or urethane anesthesia and, furthermore, that it also does not arise during natural slow-wave sleep. Therefore, respiratory-related oscillatory neural activities are likely limited to primary olfactory structures during slow-wave forebrain states.",,"This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Grant RGPIN 249861 to C.T.D.) and the Branch Out Neurological Foundation (summer studentship funding to J.M.V.).

However, the diagnostic predictive power of the existing algorithms has been limited by small sample sizes, lack of representativeness, data leakage, and/or overfitting. Here, we overcome these limitations with the largest multi-site sample size to date (N = 5365) to provide a generalizable ML classification benchmark of major depressive disorder (MDD) using shallow linear and non-linear models. Leveraging brain measures from standardized ENIGMA analysis pipelines in FreeSurfer, we were able to classify MDD versus healthy controls (HC) with a balanced accuracy of around 62%. But after harmonizing the data, e.g., using ComBat, the balanced accuracy dropped to approximately 52%. Accuracy results close to random chance levels were also observed in stratified groups according to age of onset, antidepressant use, number of episodes and sex. Future studies incorporating higher dimensional brain imaging/phenotype features, and/or using more advanced machine and deep learning methods may yield more encouraging prospects.","ENIGMA MDD: This work was supported by NIH grants U54 EB020403 (PMT) and R01MH116147 (PMT) and R01 MH117601 (NJ &amp; LS).

Dynamic cerebral autoregulation, or the ability of the cerebrovasculature to react to transient changes in arterial blood pressure, could be associated with these symptoms.MethodsIn this narrative review, we go beyond the classical view of cerebral autoregulation to discuss dynamic cerebral autoregulation, focusing on recent advances pitfalls and future directions.ResultsFollowing some historical background, this narrative review provides a brief overview of the concept of cerebral autoregulation, with a focus on the quantification of dynamic cerebral autoregulation. We then discuss the main protocols and analytical approaches to assess dynamic cerebral autoregulation, including recent advances and important issues which need to be tackled.ConclusionThe researcher or clinician new to this field needs an adequate comprehension of the toolbox they have to adequately assess, and interpret, the complex relationship between arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow in healthy individuals and clinical populations, including patients with autonomic disorders.","Patrice Brassard is supported by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Foundation of the Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, Marc-Antoine Roy is supported by a scholarship from the Société Québécoise d’hypertension artérielle, Joel S.

If so, increasing or optimizing exercise could be considered a 'disease-modifying intervention' in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Exercise intervention studies conducted in animal models of MS are promising. Various aerobic and strength training regimes have been shown to delay disease onset and to reduce both the clinical and pathological disease severity in mice. However, fundamental differences between the physiology of animals and humans, the disease states studied, and the timing of exercise intervention are significant. In animal models of MS, most exercise interventions begin before disease initiation and before any clinical sign of disease. In contrast, studies in humans recruit participants on average nearly a decade after diagnosis and often once disability is established. If, as is thought to be the case for disease-modifying treatments, the immunomodulatory effect of exercise decreases with advancing disease duration, current studies may therefore fail to detect the true disease-modifying potential. Clinical studies in early disease cohorts are needed to determine the role of exercise as a disease-modifying intervention for people with MS.",We wish to thank Professor Nathalie Arbor for the insightful discussion about animal models of MS.,This work was supported by the Branch Out Neurological Foundation.,Frontiers in Neurology,,,,2023-10-10,2023,2023-10-10,,14,,1190208,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martin, Sarah-Jane; Schneider, Raphael","Martin, Sarah-Jane (BARLO MS Center, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada; Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada; Institute of Infection & Immunity, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom); Schneider, Raphael (BARLO MS Center, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada; Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada; Institute of Medical Science, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada)","Martin, Sarah-Jane (St. Michael's Hospital; St. Michael's Hospital; University of Glasgow)","Martin, Sarah-Jane (St. Michael's Hospital; St. Michael's Hospital; University of Glasgow); Schneider, Raphael (St. Michael's Hospital; St. Michael's Hospital; University of Toronto)",5,4,1.39,3.47,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2023.1190208,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164834209,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Motor maps are typically acquired at rest, and comparisons to maps obtained during muscle activation have been both limited and contradictory. Understanding the relationship between functional activation of the corticomotor system as recorded by motor mapping is crucial for their use clinically and in research. The present study utilized robotic TMS paired with personalized neuro-navigation to examine the relationship between resting and active motor map measures and their relationship with motor performance. Twenty healthy right-handed participants underwent resting and active robotic TMS motor mapping of the first dorsal interosseous to 10% maximum voluntary contraction. Motor map parameters including map area, volume, and measures of map centrality were compared between techniques using paired sample tests of difference and Bland-Altman plots and analysis. Map area, volume, and hotspot magnitude were larger in the active motor maps, while map center of gravity and hotspot locations remained consistent between both maps. No associations were observed between motor maps and motor performance as measured by the Purdue Pegboard Test. Our findings support previous suggestions that maps scale with muscle contraction. Differences in mapping outcomes suggest rest and active motor maps may reflect functionally different corticomotor representations. Advanced analysis methods may better characterize the underlying neurophysiology of both types of motor mapping.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank Anna Bourgeois and Rose Swansburg for their contributions.

The amygdala is involved in emotion regulation, and its volume and function are associated with exposure to prenatal maternal depression. The associations between perinatal maternal anxiety and children’s amygdala structure and function remain unclear. The objective of this study was to determine associations between prenatal and postnatal maternal anxiety and amygdala structure and function in children. Maternal anxiety was measured during the second trimester of pregnancy and 12 weeks postpartum. T1-weighted anatomical data and functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 54 children (25 females), between the ages of 3–7 years. Amygdala volume was calculated and functional connectivity maps were created between the amygdalae and the rest of the brain. Spearman correlations were used to test associations between amygdala volume/functional connectivity and maternal anxiety symptoms, controlling for maternal depression symptoms. Second trimester maternal anxiety symptoms were negatively associated with functional connectivity between the left amygdala and clusters in bilateral parietal regions; higher maternal anxiety was associated with increased negative connectivity. Postnatal maternal anxiety symptoms were positively associated with child amygdala volume, but this finding did not remain significant while controlling for total brain volume. These functional connectivity differences may underlie behavioral outcomes in children exposed to maternal anxiety during pregnancy.","This work was funded by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (IHD-134090; MOP-123535; MOP-136797, New Investigator Award to CL).

Longitudinal studies found that a majority of patients with m-sTBI exhibit significant hippocampal atrophy from 5 to 12 months post-injury, associated with decreased cognitive environmental enrichment (EE). Encouragingly, engaging in EE has been shown to lead to neural improvements, suggesting it is a promising avenue for offsetting hippocampal neurodegeneration in m-sTBI. Allocentric spatial navigation (ie, flexible, bird's eye view approach), is a good candidate for EE in m-sTBI because it is associated with hippocampal activation and reduced ageing-related volume loss. Efficacy of EE requires intensive daily training, prohibitive within most current health delivery systems. The present protocol is a novel, remotely delivered and self-administered intervention designed to harness principles from EE and allocentric spatial navigation to offset hippocampal atrophy and potentially improve hippocampal functions such as navigation and memory for patients with m-sTBI.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Eighty-four participants with chronic m-sTBI are being recruited from an urban rehabilitation hospital and randomised into a 16-week intervention (5 hours/week; total: 80 hours) of either targeted spatial navigation or an active control group. The spatial navigation group engages in structured exploration of different cities using Google Street View that includes daily navigation challenges. The active control group watches and answers subjective questions about educational videos. Following a brief orientation, participants remotely self-administer the intervention on their home computer. In addition to feasibility and compliance measures, clinical and experimental cognitive measures as well as MRI scan data are collected pre-intervention and post-intervention to determine behavioural and neural efficacy.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained from ethics boards at the University Health Network and University of Toronto. Findings will be presented at academic conferences and submitted to peer-reviewed journals.

We hypothesized that specific symptoms may better reveal correlates and investigated this for the severity of insomnia, both a key symptom and a modifiable major risk factor of MDD. Cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volumes were assessed from T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 1053 MDD patients (age range 13-79 years) from 15 cohorts within the ENIGMA MDD Working Group. Insomnia severity was measured by summing the insomnia items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Symptom specificity was evaluated with correlates of overall depression severity. Disease specificity was evaluated in two independent samples comprising 2108 healthy controls, and in 260 clinical controls with bipolar disorder. Results showed that MDD patients with more severe insomnia had a smaller cortical surface area, mostly driven by the right insula, left inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis, left frontal pole, right superior parietal cortex, right medial orbitofrontal cortex, and right supramarginal gyrus. Associations were specific for insomnia severity, and were not found for overall depression severity. Associations were also specific to MDD; healthy controls and clinical controls showed differential insomnia severity association profiles. The findings indicate that MDD patients with more severe insomnia show smaller surfaces in several frontoparietal cortical areas. While explained variance remains small, symptom-specific associations could bring us closer to clues on underlying biological phenomena of MDD.","This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No. 671084 - INSOMNIA, J.L., T.F.B., E.J.W.V.S.) and from the VU University Amsterdam University Research Fellowships (J.L., T.F.B.).

The current paper describes the creation of a simultaneous trimodal neuroimaging protocol. The authors detail their methodological design for a subsequent large-scale study, demonstrate the ability to obtain the expected physiologically induced responses across cerebrovascular domains, and describe the pitfalls experienced when developing this approach.Approach. Electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) were combined to provide an assessment of neuronal activity, microvascular oxygenation, and upstream artery velocity, respectively. Real-time blood pressure, capnography, and heart rate were quantified to control for the known confounding influence of cardiorespiratory variables. The EEG-fNIRS-TCD protocol was attached to a 21 year-old male who completed neurovascular coupling/functional hyperemia (finger tapping and 'Where's Waldo/Wally?'), dynamic cerebral autoregulation (squat-stand maneuvers), and cerebrovascular reactivity tasks (end-tidal clamping during hypocapnia/hypercapnia).Main results. In a pilot participant, the Waldo task produced robust hemodynamic responses within the occipital microvasculature and the posterior cerebral artery. A ∼90% decrease in alpha band power was seen in the occipital cortical region compared between the eyes closed and eyes opened protocol, compared to the frontal, central, and parietal regions (∼80% reduction). A modest increase in motor oxygenated hemoglobin was seen during the finger tapping task, with a harmonious alpha decrease of ∼15% across all cortical regions. No change in the middle or posterior cerebral arteries were noted during finger tapping. During cerebral autoregulatory challenges, sinusoidal oscillations were produced in hemodynamics at 0.05 and 0.10 Hz, while a decrease and increase in TCD and fNIRS metrics were elicited during hypocapnia and hypercapnia protocols, respectively.Significance. All neuroimaging modalities have their inherent limitations; however, these can be minimized by employing multimodal neuroimaging approaches. This EEG-fNIRS-TCD protocol enables a comprehensive assessment of cerebrovascular regulation across the association between electrical activity and cerebral hemodynamics during tasks with a mild degree of body and/or head movement.",,"J S B has funding through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) (Grant Nos.

However, changes in brain function underlying exercise-related improvements in symptoms of MS have not been fully investigated, and in no instances have they been investigated using a graph theory approach. For the first time, the effects of an exercise intervention on functional brain network connectivity were examined using graph theory analyses of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data among individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).
METHODS: Resting-state fMRI data were obtained from 10 participants before and after 12 weeks of a speeded walking intervention. Functional connectivity data were preprocessed in Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI Advanced (DPARSF A version 4.2) and analyzed in GraphVar2.02 to compute global and local graph theory metrics. To examine differences in graph metrics before and after the intervention, one-sample permutation tests were performed.
RESULTS: There were no significant pre to post exercise intervention changes in global metrics. Changes in local metrics (i.e. clustering coefficient, local efficiency, degree centrality and betweenness centrality) were mixed, with both increases and decreases observed.
CONCLUSION: Following a 12-week speeded walking exercise intervention, there were no significant increases or decreases in global graph metrics and results at the level of local metrics were equivocal in individuals with RRMS. Further research with experimental designs that include baseline and longitudinal follow-up, as well as larger sample sizes, is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of symptom improvement following exercise in RRMS.","Thank you to the individuals with MS who participated in this study.

METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive consenting patients, followed at a single centre. Patients completed a comprehensive NB, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Fatigue Severity Scale, Short-Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores and the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire. Disease activity was assessed by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000. Ward's method was used for clustering and principal component analysis was used to visualise the number of clusters. Stability at 1 year was assessed with kappa statistic.
RESULTS: Among 142 patients, three clusters were found: cluster 1 had mild symptom intensity, cluster 2 had moderate symptom intensity and cluster 3 had severe symptom intensity. At 1-year follow-up, 49% of patients remained in their baseline cluster. The mild cluster had the highest stability (77% of patients stayed in the same cluster), followed by the severe cluster (51%), and moderate cluster had the lowest stability (3%). A minority of patients from mild cluster moved to severe cluster (19%). In severe cluster, a larger number moved to moderate cluster (40%) and fewer to mild cluster (9%).
CONCLUSION: Three distinct clusters of symptom intensity were documented in patients with SLE in association with cognitive function. There was a lower tendency for patients in the mild and severe clusters to move but not moderate cluster over the course of a year. This may demonstrate an opportunity for intervention to have moderate cluster patients move to mild cluster instead of moving to severe cluster. Further studies are necessary to assess factors that affect movement into moderate cluster.",,"This project was funded by the Arthritis Society of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Physician Services Incorporated, the Province of Ontario Early Research Award, Lupus Research Alliance and Schroeder Arthritis Institute.

To detect impairments, clinicians need appropriate assessment tools. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and utility of a battery of clinical balance assessments in adults with moderate-to-severe TBI within 6-months of injury. Thirty-seven adults with TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 12 (33 M/4 F) age 18-50 years] participated in balance testing. Assessments included the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), National Institutes of Health Standing Balance Test (NIH-SBT), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), Advanced Functional Gait Assessment (FGA-A), Tandem Gait Test (TGT), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Walking While Talking Test (WWTT). We identified pronounced ceiling effects on the BBS and FGA, two widely used clinical balance assessments. The NIH-SBT, WWTT, and FGA used in conjunction with the FGA-A, offered versatility in their capacity to assess patients across the balance severity spectrum. This study provides evidence to support a stepwise approach to balance assessment that can be adapted to the broad range of balance ability found in moderate-to-severe TBI.","We thank the SiMPly Rehab team for their effort, support and expertise.

Animal models that reflect human consumption are critical to study the impact of cannabis on brain and behaviour. Most animal studies to date utilize injection of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; primary psychoactive component of cannabis). THC injections produce markedly different physiological and behavioural effects than inhalation, likely due to distinctive pharmacokinetics. The current study directly examined if administration route (injection versus inhalation) alters metabolism and central accumulation of THC and metabolites over time. Adult male and female Sprague–Dawley rats received either an intraperitoneal injection or a 15-min session of inhaled exposure to THC. Blood and brains were collected at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 240-min post-exposure for analysis of THC and metabolites. Despite achieving comparable peak blood THC concentrations in both groups, our results indicate higher initial brain THC concentration following inhalation, whereas injection resulted in dramatically higher 11-OH-THC concentration, a potent THC metabolite, in blood and brain that increased over time. Our results provide evidence of different pharmacokinetic profiles following inhalation versus injection. Accordingly, administration route should be considered during data interpretation, and translational animal work should strongly consider using inhalation models.","This study was supported by operating funds from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR TCP-431510; MNH) and the Hotchkiss Brain Institute (MNH and SL Borgland).

One such endocannabinoid is N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide, AEA), which is metabolized by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). In humans, there is a loss of function single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the FAAH gene (C385A, rs324420), that leads to increases in the levels of AEA. Using a mouse model with this SNP, we investigated how this SNP affects inflammation in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. We administered 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) intracolonically, to adult male FAAH SNP mice and examined colonic macroscopic tissue damage and myeloperoxidase activity, as well as levels of plasma and amygdalar cytokines and chemokines 3 days after administration, at the peak of colitis. We found that mice possessing the loss of function alleles (AC and AA), displayed no differences in colonic damage or myeloperoxidase activity compared to mice with wild type alleles (CC). In contrast, in plasma, colitis-induced increases in interleukin (IL)-2, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were reduced in animals with an A allele. A similar pattern was observed in the amygdala for granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and MCP-1. In the amygdala, the mutant A allele led to lower levels of IL-1α, IL-9, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β, and MIP-2 independent of colitis-providing additional understanding of how FAAH may serve as a regulator of inflammatory responses in the brain. Together, these data provide insights into how FAAH regulates inflammatory processes in disease.","We acknowledge that this work was conducted on the traditional territories of the people of the Treaty 7 region in Southern Alberta, which includes the Blackfoot Confederacy (comprising the Siksika, Piikani, and Kainai First Nations), as well as the Tsuut’ina First Nation, and the Stoney Nakoda (including the Chiniki, Bearspaw, and Wesley First Nations).

The current review aimed to amalgamate this literature and provide recommendations to create greater standardization for future research. The PubMed database was searched with inclusion criteria consisting of original research articles using driven dCA assessments in humans. Risk of bias were completed using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network and Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies. Meta-analyses were conducted for coherence, phase, and gain metrics at 0.05 and 0.10 Hz using deep-breathing, oscillatory lower body negative pressure (OLBNP), sit-to-stand maneuvers, and squat-stand maneuvers. A total of 113 studies were included, with 40 of these incorporating clinical populations. A total of 4126 participants were identified, with younger adults (18-40 years) being the most studied population. The most common techniques were squat-stands (n = 43), deep-breathing (n = 25), OLBNP (n = 20), and sit-to-stands (n = 16). Pooled coherence point estimates were: OLBNP 0.70 (95%CI:0.59-0.82), sit-to-stands 0.87 (95%CI:0.79-0.95), and squat-stands 0.98 (95%CI:0.98-0.99) at 0.05 Hz; and deep-breathing 0.90 (95%CI:0.81-0.99); OLBNP 0.67 (95%CI:0.44-0.90); and squat-stands 0.99 (95%CI:0.99-0.99) at 0.10 Hz.

These behavioral symptoms are poorly managed by conventional treatments for inflammatory diseases and contribute to quality of life impairments. Peripheral inflammation is associated with sustained elevations in circulating glucocorticoid hormones, which can modulate central processes, including those involved in the regulation of emotional behavior. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is exquisitely sensitive to these hormonal changes and is a significant regulator of emotional behavior. The impact of peripheral inflammation on central eCB function, and whether this is related to the development of these behavioral comorbidities remains to be determined. To examine this, we employed the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced model of colonic inflammation (colitis) in adult, male, Sprague Dawley rats to produce sustained peripheral inflammation. Colitis produced increases in behavioral measures of anxiety and elevations in circulating corticosterone. These alterations were accompanied by elevated hydrolytic activity of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which hydrolyzes the eCB anandamide (AEA), throughout multiple corticolimbic brain regions. This elevation of FAAH activity was associated with broad reductions in the content of AEA, whose decline was driven by central corticotropin releasing factor type 1 receptor signaling. Colitis-induced anxiety was reversed following acute central inhibition of FAAH, suggesting that the reductions in AEA produced by colitis contributed to the generation of anxiety. These data provide a novel perspective for the pharmacological management of psychiatric comorbidities of chronic inflammatory conditions through modulation of eCB signaling.","We acknowledge that this work was conducted on the traditional territories of the people of the Treaty 7 region in Southern Alberta, which includes the Blackfoot Confederacy (comprising the Siksika, Piikani, and Kainai First Nations), as well as the Tsuut’ina First Nation, and the Stoney Nakoda (including the Chiniki, Bearspaw, and Wesley First Nations).

Here we aimed to clarify the relationship between obesity and brain structure using structural MRI (n = 6420) and genetic data (n = 3907) from the ENIGMA Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) working group. Obesity (BMI > 30) was significantly associated with cortical and subcortical abnormalities in both mass-univariate and multivariate pattern recognition analyses independent of MDD diagnosis. The most pronounced effects were found for associations between obesity and lower temporo-frontal cortical thickness (maximum Cohen´s d (left fusiform gyrus) = −0.33). The observed regional distribution and effect size of cortical thickness reductions in obesity revealed considerable similarities with corresponding patterns of lower cortical thickness in previously published studies of neuropsychiatric disorders. A higher polygenic risk score for obesity significantly correlated with lower occipital surface area. In addition, a significant age-by-obesity interaction on cortical thickness emerged driven by lower thickness in older participants. Our findings suggest a neurobiological interaction between obesity and brain structure under physiological and pathological brain conditions.","The ENIGMA-Major Depressive Disorder working group gratefully acknowledges support from the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) award (U54 EB020403 to PT).

Medications that reactivate these macrophages/microglia, as well as circulating monocytes that become macrophages, could thus be useful to treat glioblastoma. We have discovered that niacin (vitamin B3) is a potential stimulator of these inefficient myeloid cells. Niacin-exposed monocytes attenuated the growth of brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) derived from glioblastoma patients by producing anti-proliferative interferon-α14. Niacin treatment of mice bearing intracranial BTICs increased macrophage/microglia representation within the tumor, reduced tumor size, and prolonged survival. These therapeutic outcomes were negated in mice depleted of circulating monocytes or harboring interferon-α receptor-deleted BTICs. Combination treatment with temozolomide enhanced niacin-promoted survival. Monocytes from glioblastoma patients had increased interferon-α14 upon niacin exposure and were reactivated to reduce BTIC growth in culture. We highlight niacin, a common vitamin that can be quickly translated into clinical application, as an immune stimulator against glioblastomas.","We acknowledge the technical help of J. Wang, C.

Although this therapy is meant for injured tissue, most protocols cool the whole body, including the contralesional hemisphere. Neuroplasticity responses within this hemisphere can affect functional outcome. Thus, cooling the contralesional hemisphere serves no clear neuroprotective function and may instead be detrimental. In this study, we cooled the contralesional hemisphere to determine whether this harms behavioral recovery after cortical injury in rats. All rats were trained on skilled reaching and walking tasks. Rats then received a motor cortex insult contralateral to their dominant paw after which they were randomly assigned to focal contralesional TH (∼33°C) for 1-48, 1-97, or 48-96 hours postinjury, or to a normothermic control group. Contralesional cooling did not impact lesion volume (p = 0.371) and had minimal impact on neurological outcome of the impaired limb. However, rats cooled early were significantly less likely to shift paw preference to the unimpaired paw (p ≤ 0.043), suggesting that cooling reduced learned nonuse. In a second experiment, we tested whether cooling impaired learning of the skilled reaching task in naive rats. Localized TH applied to the hemisphere contralateral or ipsilateral to the preferred paw did not impair learning (p ≥ 0.677) or dendritic branching/length in the motor cortex (p ≥ 0.105). In conclusion, localized TH did not impair learning or plasticity in the absence of neural injury, but contralesional TH may reduce unwanted shifts in limb preference after stroke.",,,Therapeutic Hypothermia and Temperature Management,,,"Animals; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Functional Laterality; Hypothermia, Induced; Male; Motor Cortex; Motor Skills; Neuronal Plasticity; Random Allocation; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",2018-01-03,2018,2018-01-03,2018-06,8,2,90-98,Closed,Article,"Klahr, Ana C.; Fagan, Kelly; Aziz, Jasmine R.; John, Roseleen; Colbourne, Frederick","Klahr, Ana C.

METHODS: Collagenase-induced striatal hemorrhage was produced in rats that were randomized to enriched rehabilitation or control intervention starting on day 7. Animals were euthanized on day 14 or 21, a period of ongoing cell death. We used biospectroscopic imaging techniques to precisely determine elemental and molecular changes on day 14. Hemoglobin content was assessed with resonance Raman spectroscopy. X-ray fluorescence imaging mapped iron, chlorine, potassium, calcium, and zinc. Protein aggregation, a marker of oxidative stress, and the distribution of other macromolecules were assessed with Fourier transform infrared imaging. A second study estimated hematoma volume with a spectrophotometric assay at 21 days.
RESULTS: In the first experiment, rehabilitation reduced hematoma hemoglobin content (P=0.004) and the amount of peri-hematoma iron (P<0.001). Oxidative damage was highly localized at the hematoma/peri-hematoma border and was decreased by rehabilitation (P=0.004). Lipid content in the peri-hematoma zone was increased by rehabilitation (P=0.016). Rehabilitation reduced the size of calcium deposits (P=0.040) and attenuated persistent dyshomeostasis of Cl- (P<0.001) but not K+ (P=0.060). The second study confirmed that rehabilitation decreased hematoma volume (P=0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: Rehabilitation accelerated clearance of toxic blood components and decreased chronic oxidative stress. As well, rehabilitation attenuated persistent ion dyshomeostasis. These novel effects may underlie rehabilitation-induced neuroprotection and improved recovery of function. Pharmacotherapies targeting these mechanisms may further improve outcome.",,,Stroke,,,"Animals; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Hematoma; Iron; Male; Oxidative Stress; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission;

A promising approach for non-invasive gene delivery to the brain is to administer recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) intravenously and allow them to cross the BBB at precise FUS-targeted brain regions. FUS-AAV delivery has been achieved in animal models; however, the key elements influencing, guiding, and monitoring the success of FUS-AAV delivery to the brain remain largely unknown. We systematically compared the ability of AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, AAV8, AAV9, and AAVrg to enter four specific brain regions and transduce two main cell types: neurons and astrocytes. Our results demonstrate that the AAV serotype, the extent of FUS-induced BBB permeability, and the intrinsic properties of the targeted brain tissue influence the observed biodistribution, diffusion and transduction of AAV to cells of the cerebrovasculature and brain parenchyma. Non-invasive contrast-enhanced MR imaging was found to predict the efficacy of FUS-AAV delivery. Notably, we also found that AAVs with high biodistribution to peripheral organs result in low gene delivery to the brain when combined with FUS. Gene delivery by AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, AAV8 and AAV9 was highly and selectively localized to FUS-targeted brain areas. To obtain non-invasive gene delivery to multiple brain regions with one area of FUS-BBB modulation, we combined a modified AAV2 vector harboring enhanced retrograde transport properties (AAVrg) with FUS-mediated brain delivery. This allowed for gene delivery from the FUS-targeted site to multiple connected brain regions. This study demonstrates that MR imaging can be used as a non-invasive indication of AAV delivery to the brain, and that the properties of AAV serotypes influence the efficacy of gene delivery to the brain with FUS. AAVs that have minimal peripheral biodistribution are ideal candidates for enhanced, and perhaps exclusive with future serotypes, delivery to the brain with FUS. The characterization of parameters influencing FUS-AAV delivery to the brain are critical to the design of safe and efficient gene therapies, from preclinical studies to future clinical applications.","We are grateful to Kristina Mikloska, Shawna Rideout and Viva Chan for their invaluable expertise on animal preparation and managing the ultrasound and MR instruments.

Whereas much is known about the consequences of prenatal nicotine exposure, relatively little is understood about how maternal preconception nicotine impacts the next generation. Positive experiences, such as environmental enrichment/complexity, have considerable potential to improve developmental outcomes and even treat and prevent drug addiction. Therefore, the current study sought to identify how maternal exposure to moderate levels of nicotine prior to conception impacts offspring development, and if the presumably negative consequence of nicotine could be reversed by concurrent exposure to an enriched environment. We treated female Long Evans rats with nicotine in their drinking water (15 mg nicotine salt/L) for seven weeks while residing in either standard or enriched conditions. Both experiences occurred exclusively prior to mating. Nicotine exposure reduced dam fertility by ~20% (p = .06). Females reared their own litters, and offspring were tested in two assessments of early development: negative geotaxis and open field. Offspring were euthanized at weaning (P21), and their brains were processed with Golgi-Cox solution to allow quantification of dendritic spine density. Results indicate that neither maternal nicotine or enrichment had an impact on maternal care, but male offspring were impaired at negative geotaxis due to maternal nicotine, female offspring showed altered open field exploration due to maternal enrichment, and offspring of both sexes had increased spine density in OFC due to maternal enrichment. Therefore, this experiment provides novel insights into the unique, sex-dependent consequences of maternal preconception nicotine and enrichment on the early development of rat behavior and brain.",The authors would like to acknowledge Animal Care Services at the University of Lethbridge for their essential role in animal husbandry.,This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to R.G.

Although these systems regulate overlapping functions, few studies have investigated whether these systems interact. Here we demonstrate a novel mechanism of CRH-induced anxiety that relies on modulation of endocannabinoids. Specifically, we found that CRH, through activation of the CRH receptor type 1 (CRHR1), evokes a rapid induction of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which causes a reduction in the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), within the amygdala. Similarly, the ability of acute stress to modulate amygdala FAAH and AEA in both rats and mice is also mediated through CRHR1 activation. This interaction occurs specifically in amygdala pyramidal neurons and represents a novel mechanism of endocannabinoid-CRH interactions in regulating amygdala output. Functionally, we found that CRH signaling in the amygdala promotes an anxious phenotype that is prevented by FAAH inhibition. Together, this work suggests that rapid reductions in amygdala AEA signaling following stress may prime the amygdala and facilitate the generation of downstream stress-linked behaviors. Given that endocannabinoid signaling is thought to exert ""tonic"" regulation on stress and anxiety responses, these data suggest that CRH signaling coordinates a disruption of tonic AEA activity to promote a state of anxiety, which in turn may represent an endogenous mechanism by which stress enhances anxiety. These data suggest that FAAH inhibitors may represent a novel class of anxiolytics that specifically target stress-induced anxiety.",,"This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to M.N.H. and National Institutes of Health Grants MH090412 and R21 MH103515 to S.P., J.M.G. was supported by a Postdoctoral Fellowship from Alberta Innovates Health Solutions.

Quantitative measurement method of this type of cognitive–motor abnormality, however, remains poorly developed. Here we examined whether stepping-in-place (SIP) with a concurrent mental task (e.g., subtraction) can be used as a simple method for evaluating cognitive–motor deficits in PD. We used a 4th generation iPod Touch sensor system to capture hip flexion data and obtain step height (SH) measurements (z axis). The accuracy of the method was compared to and validated by kinematic video analysis software. We found a general trend of reduced SH for PD subjects relative to controls under all conditions. However, the SH of PD freezers was significantly worse than PD non-freezers and controls during concurrent serial 7 subtraction and SIP tasking. During serial 7 subtraction, SH was significantly associated with whether or not a PD patient was a self-reported freezer even when controlling for disease severity. Given that this SIP-based dual-task paradigm is not limited by space requirements and can be quantified using a mobile tracking device that delivers specifically designed auditory task instructions, the method reported here may be used to standardize clinical assessment of cognitive–motor deficits under a variety of dual-task conditions in PD.",,,Journal of Neural Transmission,,,"Aged; Attention; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cognition Disorders; Computers, Handheld; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Gait Disorders, Neurologic; Hip; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Neuropsychological Tests; Parkinson Disease; Self Report; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index; Video Recording; Wireless Technology",2015-07-24,2015,2015-07-24,2015-11,122,11,1523-1531,Closed,Article,"Chomiak, Taylor; Pereira, Fernando Vieira; Meyer, Nicole; de Bruin, Natalie; Derwent, Lorelei; Luan, Kailie; Cihal, Alexandra; Brown, Lesley A.; Hu, Bin","Chomiak, Taylor (Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, 3330 Hospital Drive NW, T2N 4N1, Calgary, AB, Canada; 1C46 HRIC, 3280 Hospital Drive NW, T2N 4N1, Calgary, AB, Canada); Pereira, Fernando Vieira (Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, 3330 Hospital Drive NW, T2N 4N1, Calgary, AB, Canada); Meyer, Nicole (Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, 3330 Hospital Drive NW, T2N 4N1, Calgary, AB, Canada); de Bruin, Natalie (Department of Kinesiology, University of Lethbridge, 4401 University Drive, T1K 3M4, Lethbridge, AB, Canada); Derwent, Lorelei (Movement Disorders Clinic, Foothills Medical Centre, Alberta Health Services, Health Sciences Building, First Floor, Area 3, 1403 29 Street NW, T2N 2T9, Calgary, AB, Canada); Luan, Kailie (Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, 3330 Hospital Drive NW, T2N 4N1, Calgary, AB, Canada); Cihal, Alexandra (Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, 3330 Hospital Drive NW, T2N 4N1, Calgary, AB, Canada); Brown, Lesley A.

To date, results have been mixed, most studies were underpowered and definitive conclusions are not available. Using lessons learned from prior negative trials in stroke, we reappraise prior randomized controlled trials that examined the use of CPAP in treating poststroke OSA and propose the following considerations: (1) Intervention-based changes, such as ensuring that patients are using CPAP for at least 4 hours per night (eg, through use of improvements in CPAP technology that make it easier for patients to use), as well as considering alternative treatment strategies for poststroke OSA; (2) Population-based changes (ie, including stroke patients with severe and symptomatic OSA and CPAP noncompliers); and (3) Changes to timing of intervention and follow-up (ie, early initiation of CPAP therapy within the first 48 hours of stroke and long-term follow-up calculated in accordance with sample size to ensure adequate power). Given the burden of vascular morbidity and mortality in stroke patients with OSA, there is a strong need to learn from past negative trials and explore innovative stroke prevention strategies to improve stroke-free survival.","AHI indicates apnea-hypopnea index; CPAP, continuous positive airway pressure; ICH, intracerebral hemorrhage; NA, not applicable; NIHSS, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; OSA, obstructive sleep apnea; and PSG, in-laboratory polysomnography (level 1).

Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) can induce long lasting plastic changes in human brain; however, the efficacy of different simulation protocols has not been investigated at the cerebellum. Here, we compare a traditional 50-Hz and a modified 30-Hz cTBS protocols at modulating cerebellar activity in healthy subjects. Seventeen healthy adults participated in two testing sessions where they received either 50-Hz (cTBS50) or 30-Hz (cTBS30) cerebellar cTBS. Cerebellar brain inhibition (CBI), a measure of cerebello-thalamocortical pathway strength, and motor evoked potentials (MEP) were measured in the dominant first dorsal interosseous muscle before and after (up to ~ 40 min) cerebellar cTBS. Both cTBS protocols induced cerebellar depression, indicated by significant reductions in CBI (P < 0.001). No differences were found between protocols (cTBS50 and cTBS30) at any time point (P = 0.983). MEP amplitudes were not significantly different following either cTBS protocol (P = 0.130). The findings show cerebellar excitability to be equally depressed by 50-Hz and 30-Hz cTBS in heathy adults and support future work to explore the efficacy of different cerebellar cTBS protocols in movement disorder patients where cerebellar depression could provide therapeutic benefits.","The authors would like to thank Dr. Oury Monchi for use of his laboratory space, and Rachel Sondergaard for assistance with data collection.",,The Cerebellum,,,"Adult; Cerebellum; Cerebral Cortex; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Female; Hand; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Neural Inhibition; Neural Pathways; Thalamus; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Young Adult",2018-08-16,2018,2018-08-16,2019-04,18,2,157-165,All OA; Green,Article,"Strzalkowski, Nicholas D.

Eleven individuals aged 17-31 (6 females/5 males) participated in two randomized separate visits, 1 week apart. A ramp-incremental test was performed during both visits until volitional failure. Visits included no pressure (control) or LBNP at -40 Torr (experimental) with head-up tilt at 15 degrees (females) or 30 degrees (males). Transcranial Doppler ultrasound was utilized to quantify middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv), while symptom reports were filled out before and 0, 10, and 60 min post-exertion. Ratings of exertion and overall condition followed similar trends for participants across both tests. The relative increase in MCAv was blunted during the experimental condition (8%) compared to control (24%), while a greater heart rate (17 beats/min) was achieved during the LBNP condition (P = 0.047). Symptom severity at the 0 and 10 min post-exertion time points displayed negligible-to-small effect sizes between conditions (Wilcoxon's r < 0.11). Symptom reporting was lower at the 60 min post-exertion time point with these displaying a moderate effect size (Wilcoxon's r = 0.31). The combination of LBNP and tilt during supine cycling did not change the participants' subjective interpretation of the exertional test but attenuated the hyperpnia-induced vasodilatory MCAv response, while also enabling participants to achieve a higher heart rate during exercise and reduced symptoms 1 h later. As this protocol is safe and feasible, further research is warranted in this area for developing PPCS treatment options. HIGHLIGHTS: What is the central question of this study? What are the feasibility, safety and utility of combining head-up tilt with lower body negative pressure during supine cycling for blunting the increase in cerebral blood velocity seen during moderate-intensity exercise in individuals experiencing persisting post-concussion symptoms? What is the main finding and its importance? Although no differences were found in symptoms between conditions within the first 10 min following exertion, symptom severity scores showed a clinically meaningful reduction 60 min following the experimental condition compared to the non-experimental control condition.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST None declared.,,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Physiology and Cognate Medical Sciences,,,,2024-08-05,2024,2024-08-05,2024-08-05,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Javra, Raelyn; Burma, Joel S.; Johnson, Nathan E.; Smirl, Jonathan D.","Javra, Raelyn (Cerebrovascular Concussion Lab, Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Sport Injury Prevention Research Centre, Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Human Performance Laboratory, Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Integrated Concussion Research Program, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada); Burma, Joel S.

Aerobic exercise is an easily implementable, non-pharmacological intervention to treat TBI, however, there are no clear guidelines for how to best implement aerobic exercise treatment for TBI survivors across age and injury severity.
Methods: We conducted a PRISMA-ScR to examine research on exercise interventions following TBI in children, youth and adults, spanning mild to severe TBI. Three electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science) were searched systematically by two authors, using keywords delineated from ""Traumatic Brain Injury,"" ""Aerobic Exercise,"" and ""Intervention.""
Results: Of the 415 papers originally identified from the search terms, 54 papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. The papers were first grouped by participants' injury severity, and subdivided based on age at intervention, and time since injury where appropriate.
Discussion: Aerobic exercise is a promising intervention for adolescent and adult TBI survivors, regardless of injury severity. However, research examining the benefits of post-injury aerobic exercise for children and older adults is lacking.",,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

To date, the properties of the AAVs used for MRIgFUS delivery resulted in cell transduction limited to MRIgFUS-targeted sites. Considering future clinical applications, strategies are needed to deliver genes to multiple locations and large brain volumes while creating minimal BBB modulation. Here we combine MRIgFUS with a vector that has enhanced biodistribution following brain entry, AAV2-HBKO, to mediate broad gene delivery to targeted brain regions at levels with potential therapeutic relevance. Expression of a reporter gene was achieved in 13% and 21% of all neurons present in the striatum and thalamus, respectively, while targeting only 28% of the brain regions with MRIgFUS. Compared with AAV9, MRIgFUS-mediated delivery of AAV2-HBKO showed greater diffusion in the brain and a higher percentage of the neurons expressing the transgene. MRIgFUS AAV2-HBKO gene delivery to the brain has the potential to reach levels that are functionally and clinically relevant, and this even when using relatively low intravenous AAV dosages, compared with what is currently used in clinical trials.","The authors thank Kristina Mikloska, Shawna Rideout, and Viva Chan for their expertise on managing the MRIgFUS instruments and preparing the animals during the MRIgFUS procedures.

A Case for Microglia’s Prominent Role in the Therapeutic Action of Anesthetics, Ketamine, and Psychedelics","There is much excitement surrounding recent research of promising, mechanistically novel psychotherapeutics – psychedelic, anesthetic, and dissociative agents – as they have demonstrated surprising efficacy in treating central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as mood disorders and addiction. However, the mechanisms by which these drugs provide such profound psychological benefits are still to be fully elucidated. Microglia, the CNS’s resident innate immune cells, are emerging as a cellular target for psychiatric disorders because of their critical role in regulating neuroplasticity and the inflammatory environment of the brain. The following paper is a review of recent literature surrounding these neuropharmacological therapies and their demonstrated or hypothesized interactions with microglia. Through investigating the mechanism of action of psychedelics, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide, ketamine, and propofol, we demonstrate a largely under-investigated role for microglia in much of the emerging research surrounding these pharmacological agents. Among others, we detail sigma-1 receptors, serotonergic and γ-aminobutyric acid signalling, and tryptophan metabolism as pathways through which these agents modulate microglial phagocytic activity and inflammatory mediator release, inducing their therapeutic effects. The current review includes a discussion on future directions in the field of microglial pharmacology and covers bidirectional implications of microglia and these novel pharmacological agents in aging and age-related disease, glial cell heterogeneity, and state-of-the-art methodologies in microglial research.Graphical Abstract","This research was supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) of Canada and ERA-NET Neuron, Synaptic Dysfunction in Disorders of the Central Nervous System (MicroSynDep) grants awarded to M-ÈT.

NEW METHOD: A contoured running wheel that has a built-in radio-frequency identification (RFID) receiver to monitor the activity of several mice in a single cage is presented. This system is scalable , the interface is easy to use, and the wheel can be dynamically locked so that each group-housed mouse receives a set exercise regimen.
RESULTS: We were able to reliably monitor three mice that were group-housed. We were able to reliably meter the amount of exercise performed by the mice using the servo-controlled lock.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Current methods allow a wheel to be locked when a set distance is reached. However, an issue with this method is that the set distance includes the cumulative activity of all mice in the cage so one mouse could contribute a disproportionate amount to the total distance. Our solution ensures that the wheel is locked when an individual mouse reaches the target distance, but remains unlocked for individuals that have not reached the programmed distance.
CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic locking wheel (DynaLok) is designed to allow a researcher to provide individually designed exercise plans for multi-housed mice; therefore, users are able to house mice conventionally rather than in individual cages. DynaLok reduces animal housing costs, allows for new experimental exercise regimens to be developed, and is scalable and cost-effective.","We would like to acknowledge support from the Whelan Lab and the following members: Dr. Celine Jean-Xavier, Dr. Charlie Kwok.

Microglia originate in the embryonic yolk sac during development and populate the CNS before the blood-brain barrier forms. In the CNS, they constitute a self-renewing population. Although they represent up to 10% of all brain cells, we are only beginning to understand how much brain homeostasis relies on their physiological functions. Often compared to a double-edged sword, microglia hold the potential to exert neuroprotective roles that can also exacerbate neurodegeneration once compromised. Microglia can promote synaptic growth in addition to eliminating synapses that are less active. Synaptic loss, which is considered one of the best pathological correlates of cognitive decline, is a distinctive feature of major depressive disorder (MDD) and cognitive aging. Long-term psychological stress accelerates cellular aging and predisposes to various diseases, including MDD, and cognitive decline. Among the underlying mechanisms, stress-induced neuroinflammation alters microglial interactions with the surrounding parenchymal cells and exacerbates oxidative burden and cellular damage, hence inducing changes in microglia and neurons typical of cognitive aging. Focusing on microglial interactions with neurons and their synapses, this review discusses the disrupted communication between these cells, notably involving fractalkine signaling and the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM). Overall, chronic stress emerges as a key player in cellular aging by altering the microglial sensome, notably via fractalkine signaling deficiency. To study cellular aging, novel positron emission tomography radiotracers for TREM and the purinergic family of receptors show interest for human study.","We are grateful to our colleagues for sharing their insights and contributing to our manuscript through their expertise and time, especially Ifeoluwa O.

Objective: To investigate the association between SRC and plasma biomarkers in adolescents.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study in Canadian sport and clinic settings (Surveillance in High Schools and Community Sport to Reduce Concussions and Their Consequences study; September 2019 to November 2022). Participants were a convenience sample of 849 adolescent (ages 10-18 years) sport participants with blood samples. Data were analyzed from February to September 2023.
Exposures: Blood collection and clinical testing preseason (uninjured) and post-SRC follow-ups (ie, ≤72 hours, 1 week, and biweekly until medical clearance to return to play [RTP]).
Main Outcomes and Measures: Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1), neurofilament light (NfL), and total tau (t-tau) were assayed. Group-level comparisons of biomarker levels were conducted between uninjured and post-SRC intervals (postinjury day [PID] 0-3, 4-10, 11-28, and >28) considering age and sex as modifiers. Secondary analyses explored associations between biomarker concentrations and clinical outcomes (Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, Fifth Edition [SCAT5] symptom scores and time to RTP).
Results: This study included 1023 plasma specimens from 695 uninjured participants (467 male participants [67.2%]; median [IQR] age, 15.90 [15.13-16.84] years) and 154 participants with concussion (78 male participants [51.0%]; median [IQR] age, 16.12 [15.31-17.11] years). Acute (PID 0-3) differences relative to uninjured levels were found for GFAP (female participants: 17.8% increase; β = 0.164; 95% CI, 0.064 to 0.263; P = .001; male participants: 17.1% increase; β = 0.157; 95% CI, 0.086 to 0.229; P < .001), UCH-L1 (female participants: 43.4% increase; β = 0.361; 95% CI, 0.125 to 0.596; P = .003), NfL (male participants: 19.0% increase; β = 0.174; 95% CI, 0.087 to 0.261; P < .001), and t-tau (female participants: -22.9%; β = -0.260; 95% CI, -0.391 to -0.130; P < .001; male participants: -18.4%; β = -0.203; 95% CI, -0.300 to -0.106; P < .001). Differences were observed for all biomarkers at PID 4 to 10, 11 to 28, and greater than 28 compared with uninjured groups. GFAP, NfL, and t-tau were associated with SCAT5 symptom scores across several PID intervals. Higher GFAP after 28 days post-SRC was associated with earlier clearance to RTP (hazard ratio, 4.78; 95% CI, 1.59 to 14.31; P = .01). Male participants exhibited lower GFAP (-9.7%), but higher UCH-L1 (21.3%) compared with female participants. Age was associated with lower GFAP (-5.4% per year) and t-tau (-5.3% per year).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of 849 adolescents, plasma biomarkers differed between uninjured participants and those with concussions, supporting their continued use to understand concussion neuropathology. Age and sex are critical considerations as these biomarkers progress toward clinical validation.",,"Funding/Support: This work is aligned with the Surveillance in High Schools and Community Sports to Reduce Concussions and Their Consequences study, which is supported by the National Football League’s Play Smart Play Safe Program.",JAMA Network Open,,,"Humans; Adolescent; Male; Female; Biomarkers; Brain Concussion; Prospective Studies; Athletic Injuries; Child; tau Proteins; Neurofilament Proteins; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Canada; Brain Injuries, Traumatic",2024-09-03,2024,2024-09-05,2024-09-03,7,9,e2431959,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tabor, Jason B.; Penner, Linden C.; Galarneau, Jean-Michel; Josafatow, Nik; Cooper, Jennifer; Ghodsi, Mohammad; Huang, Johnny; Fraser, Douglas D.; Smirl, Jonathan; Esser, Michael J.; Yeates, Keith Owen; Wellington, Cheryl L.; Debert, Chantel T.; Emery, Carolyn A.","Tabor, Jason B.

The fragmented understanding of the mechanisms underlying autonomic dysreflexia hampers the development of therapeutic strategies to manage this condition, leaving people with SCI at daily risk of heart attack and stroke2, 3, 4–5. Here we expose the neuronal architecture that develops after SCI and causes autonomic dysreflexia. In parallel, we uncover a competing, yet overlapping neuronal architecture activated by epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord that safely regulates blood pressure after SCI. The discovery that these adversarial neuronal architectures converge onto a single neuronal subpopulation provided a blueprint for the design of a mechanism-based intervention that reversed autonomic dysreflexia in mice, rats and humans with SCI. These results establish a path towards essential pivotal device clinical trials that will establish the safety and efficacy of epidural electrical stimulation for the effective treatment of autonomic dysreflexia in people with SCI.","This work was financially supported by: Eurostars project E!113969 PREP2GO; DARPA subaward A21-0795-S001 (P.O. 1083297); the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs through the Spinal Cord Injury Research Program (HT9425-23-1-0547); Eurostars E!1748 IMPULSE; Medtronic (ERP-2020-12543); Onward Medical, PHRT-279; University of Calgary Reserach Excellence Chair; Brain Canada; Digital Research Alliance of Canada; the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; the Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Alberta Innovates Health Solutions; Campus Alberta Neuroscience; the Libin Cardiovascular Institute; the Hotchkiss Brain Institute; the Hopewell M.I.N.D.

Evidence suggests that altered VN signaling is linked to changes in the neuroimmune system, including microglia. Dysfunction of microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the brain, is associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and epilepsy. While the mechanistic understanding linking the VN, microglia, and neurodevelopmental disorders remains incomplete, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may provide a better understanding of the VN's mechanisms and act as a possible treatment modality. In this review we examine the VN's important role in modulating the immune system through the inflammatory reflex, which involves the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, which releases acetylcholine. Within the central nervous system (CNS), the direct release of acetylcholine can also be triggered by VNS. Homeostatic balance in the CNS is notably maintained by microglia. Microglia facilitate neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, and astrogenesis, and promote neuronal survival via trophic factor release. These cells also monitor the CNS microenvironment through a complex sensome, including groups of receptors and proteins enabling microglia to modify neuroimmune health and CNS neurochemistry. Given the limitations of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, this review seeks to explore the application of VNS as an intervention for neurodevelopmental conditions. Accordingly, we review the established mechanisms of VNS action, e.g., modulation of microglia and various neurotransmitter pathways, as well as emerging preclinical and clinical evidence supporting VNS's impact on symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as those related to CNS inflammation induced by infections. We also discuss the potential of adapting non-invasive VNS for the prevention and treatment of these conditions. Overall, this review is intended to increase the understanding of VN's potential for alleviating microglial dysfunction involved in schizophrenia, ADHD, ASD, and epilepsy. Additionally, we aim to reveal new concepts in the field of CNS inflammation and microglia, which could serve to understand the mechanisms of VNS in the development of new therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders.","We acknowledge and respect that the University of Victoria is located on the territory of the lək̓ʷəŋən peoples and that the Songhees, Esquimalt, and WSÁNEÆ peoples have relationships to this land.

We employed near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a noninvasive neuroimaging technique, to determine whether patients with PBC exhibit reduced cerebral oxygen saturation (StO2 ) and altered patterns of microvascular cerebral blood perfusion and whether these alterations were associated with clinical phenotype. This observational case-control study was conducted at a tertiary hospital clinic (University of Calgary Liver Unit).
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Thirteen female patients with noncirrhotic PBC, seven female patients with cirrhotic PBC, and 11 healthy female controls were recruited by physician referral and word of mouth, respectively. NIRS was used to measure cerebral hemoglobin and oxygen saturation. A wavelet phase coherence method was used to estimate the coherent frequency coupling of temporal changes in cerebral hemodynamics. The PBC group demonstrated significantly reduced cerebral StO2 (P = 0.01, d = 0.84), indicating cerebral hypoxia, significantly increased cerebral deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration (P < 0.01, d = 0.86), and significantly reduced hemodynamic coherence in the low-frequency band (0.08-0.15 Hz) for oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (P = 0.02, d = 0.99) and total hemoglobin (tHb) concentration (P = 0.02, d = 0.50), indicating alterations in cerebrovascular activity. Complete biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy in early patients with PBC was associated with increased cerebral tHb concentration and decreased hemodynamic coherence.
CONCLUSIONS: Using NIRS, patients with PBC were found to have hypoxia, increased cerebral hemoglobin concentration, and altered cerebrovascular activity, which were reversed in part in UDCA responders. In addition, symptoms and quality-of-life measures did not correlate with brain hypoxia or cerebrovascular dysregulation in patients with PBC.",,,Hepatology,,,"Adult; Aged; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Cholangitis; Female; Humans; Hypoxia, Brain; Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary; Middle Aged; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",2020-04,2020,2020-04,2020-04,71,4,1408-1420,Closed,Article,"Duszynski, Chris C.; Avati, V.; Lapointe, A.P.; Scholkmann, F.; Dunn, J.F.; Swain, M.G.","Duszynski, Chris C.

We aimed to gather information regarding existing models of MS care across Canada, and to assess the perceptions of health care providers (HCPs) regarding the models of care required to fully meet the needs of the person with MS.
Methods: We conducted an anonymous online survey targeting Canadian HCPs working in MS Clinics, and neurologists delivering MS care whether or not they were based in an MS Clinic. We queried the types of HCPs delivering care within formal MS Clinics, wait times for HCPs, the perceived importance of different types of HCPs for good quality care, assessments conducted, and whether clinic databases were used. We summarized survey responses using descriptive statistics.
Results: Of the 716 HCPs to whom the survey was distributed, 100 (13.9%) people responded. Of the 100 respondents, 85 (85%) indicated that their clinical practice included people with MS and responded to specific questions about clinical care. The most common types of providers within MS Clinics with integrated models of care were neurologists and MS nurses. Of 23 responding MS Clinics, 10 (43.5%) indicated that there were not enough neurologists, and 16 (69.6%) indicated that there were not enough non-neurologist HCPs to provide adequate care. More than 50% of clinics reported wait times exceeding 3 months for physiatrists, physiotherapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, neuropsychologists and urologists; in some clinics wait times for these providers exceeded 1 year. Multiple disciplines were identified as important or very important for delivering good quality MS care. Over 90% of respondents thought it was important for neurologists, nurse practitioners, MS nurses and psychiatrists to be co-located within MS Clinics.
Conclusion: Canadian HCPs viewed the ideal MS service as being multidisciplinary in nature and ideally integrated. Efforts are needed to improve timely access to specialized MS care in Canada, and to evaluate how outcomes are influenced by access to care.","The investigators thank Michelle Eisner for her assistance in coordinating team meetings and collating survey distribution lists, and Julia Rempel for implementing the survey in REDCap.","This study was funded in part by the Waugh Family Chair in Multiple Sclerosis.

Maternal stress prior to conception has recently been shown to exert similar influences on the offspring. The present study questioned if a consistent maternal stressor prior to conception (elevated platform stress) would impact the pre-weaning development of offspring brain and behavior, and if maternal care was vulnerable to this experience. Adult female Long-Evans rats were subjected to elevated platform stress for 27 days prior to mating with non-stressed males. Maternal care was monitored, and pups were assessed in two tests of early behavioral development, negative geotaxis and open field. Pups were perfused at weaning and their brains were extracted and stained with Cresyl Violet, allowing gross measurements of cortical and subcortical structures and estimates of neuron density. Main findings indicate that a change in prefrontal cortical thickness is evident despite no change in maternal care. Female offspring show a decrease in medial-dorsal thalamus size. The current study failed to find an effect of maternal preconception stress on early behavioral development. These results suggest that the PFC, and likely behavior dependent on the PFC, is vulnerable to maternal preconception stress and that a strong sex effect is evident. Further studies should examine how such offspring fare using a lifespan model and investigate potential mechanisms responsible for these effects.",The authors would like to acknowledge Leora Hiar for her assistance in behavioral scoring.,,Neuroscience,,,"Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cell Count; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Male; Maternal Behavior; Prefrontal Cortex; Pregnancy; Rats, Long-Evans; Stress, Psychological; Thalamus",2018-10-24,2018,2018-10-24,2018-12,394,,98-108,Closed,Article,"Jenkins, Serena; Harker, Allonna; Gibb, Robbin","Jenkins, Serena (Canadian Centre for Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Lethbridge, 4401 University Dr W, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.

Identifying measurable indicators of brain processes associated with MDD could facilitate the detection of individuals at risk, and the development of novel treatments, the monitoring of treatment effects, and predicting who might benefit most from treatments that target specific brain mechanisms. However, despite intensive neuroimaging research towards this effort, underpowered studies and a lack of reproducible findings have hindered progress. Here, we discuss the work of the ENIGMA Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Consortium, which was established to address issues of poor replication, unreliable results, and overestimation of effect sizes in previous studies. The ENIGMA MDD Consortium currently includes data from 45 MDD study cohorts from 14 countries across six continents. The primary aim of ENIGMA MDD is to identify structural and functional brain alterations associated with MDD that can be reliably detected and replicated across cohorts worldwide. A secondary goal is to investigate how demographic, genetic, clinical, psychological, and environmental factors affect these associations. In this review, we summarize findings of the ENIGMA MDD disease working group to date and discuss future directions. We also highlight the challenges and benefits of large-scale data sharing for mental health research.","ENIGMA MDD work is supported by NIH grants U54 EB020403 (Thompson), R01 MH116147 (Thompson), and R01 MH117601 (Jahanshad &amp; Schmaal).

However, examining the role of AEA signaling in stress, anxiety, and fear through pharmacological depletion has been challenging due to the redundant complexity of its biosynthesis and the lack of a pharmacological synthesis inhibitor. We developed a herpes simplex viral vector to rapidly yet transiently overexpress FAAH specifically within the BLA to assess the impact of suppressing AEA signaling on stress, fear, and anxiety in male rats. Surprisingly, FAAH overexpression in BLA dampened stress-induced corticosterone release, reduced anxiety-like behaviors, and decreased conditioned fear expression. Interestingly, depleting AEA signaling in the BLA did not prevent fear conditioning itself or fear reinstatement. These effects were specific to the overexpression of FAAH because they were reversed by intra-BLA administration of an FAAH inhibitor. Moreover, the fear-suppressive effects of FAAH overexpression were also mitigated by intra-BLA administration of a low dose of a GABAA receptor antagonist, but not an NMDA/AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, suggesting that they were mediated by an increase in GABAergic neurotransmission. Our data suggest that a permissive AEA tone within the BLA might gate GABA release and that loss of this tone through elevated AEA hydrolysis increases inhibition in the BLA, which in turn reduces stress, anxiety, and fear. These data provide new insights on the mechanisms by which amygdalar endocannabinoid signaling regulates emotional behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Amygdala endocannabinoid signaling is involved in the regulation of stress, anxiety, and fear. Our data indicate that viral-mediated augmentation of anandamide hydrolysis within the basolateral amygdala reduces behavioral indices of stress, anxiety, and conditioned fear expression. These same effects have been previously documented with inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis in the same brain region. Our results indicate that the ability of anandamide signaling to regulate emotional behavior is nonlinear and may involve actions at distinct neuronal populations, which could be influenced by the basal level of anandamide. Modulation of anandamide signaling is a current clinical therapeutic target for stress-related psychiatric illnesses, so these data underscore the importance of fully understanding the mechanisms by which anandamide signaling regulates amygdala-dependent changes in emotionality.",,This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (M.N.H. and S.A.J.) and Brain Canada (M.N.H.).

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an acute psychological stress on changes in mRNA and protein levels of a wide range of inflammatory mediators across a broad temporal range, in key corticolimbic brain regions involved in the regulation of the stress response (amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, medial prefrontal cortex). mRNA levels of inflammatory mediators were analyzed immediately following 30min or 120min of acute restraint stress and protein levels were examined 0h through 24h post-termination of 120min of acute restraint stress using both multiplex and ELISA methods. Our data demonstrate, for the first time, that exposure to acute psychological stress results in an increase in the protein level of several inflammatory mediators in the amygdala while concomitantly producing a decrease in the protein level of multiple inflammatory mediators within the medial prefrontal cortex. This pattern of changes seemed largely restricted to the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex, with stress producing few changes in the mRNA or protein levels of inflammatory mediators within the hippocampus or hypothalamus. Consistent with previous research, stress resulted in a general elevation in multiple inflammatory mediators within the circulation. These data indicate that neuroinflammatory responses to stress do not appear to be generalized across brain structures and exhibit a high degree of spatiotemporal specificity. Given the impact of inflammatory signaling on neural excitability and emotional behavior, these data may provide a platform with which to explore the importance of inflammatory signaling within the prefrontocortical-amygdala circuit in the regulation of the neurobehavioral responses to stress.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank Drs.

One factor that is being explored throughout patient care is the idea of diet and the role it has on patient outcomes. But the effects of diet following neurotrauma need to be carefully explored in animal models to ensure that they have beneficial effects. The ketogenic diet provides sufficient daily caloric requirements while being potentially neuroprotective and analgesic. In this study, animals were fed a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that led to a high concentration of blood ketone that was sustained for as long as the animals were on the diet. Mice fed a ketogenic diet had significantly lower levels of tyrosine and tryptophan, but the levels of other monoamines within the spinal cord remained similar to those of control mice. Mice were fed a standard or ketogenic diet for 7 d before and 28 d following the injury. Our results show that mice hemisected over the T10-T11 vertebrae showed no beneficial effects of being on a ketogenic diet over a 28 d recovery period. Similarly, ligation of the common peroneal and tibial nerve showed no differences between mice fed normal or ketogenic diets. Tests included von Frey, open field, and ladder-rung crossing. We add to existing literature showing protective effects of the ketogenic diet in forelimb injuries by focusing on neurotrauma in the hindlimbs. The results suggest that ketogenic diets need to be assessed based on the type and location of neurotrauma.","Acknowledgments: We thank Michelle Tran, Gail Rauw, and James Wong for technical assistance on HPLC experiments.",,eNeuro,,,"Animals; Diet, Ketogenic; Disease Models, Animal; Mice; Quality of Life; Spinal Cord Injuries",2020-07-17,2020,2020-07-17,2020-07,7,4,eneuro.0178-20.2020,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mayr, Kyle A.; Kwok, Charlie H.T.; Eaton, Shane E.A.; Baker, Glen B.; Whelan, Patrick J.","Mayr, Kyle A.

We recently developed a preclinical model that allows the identification of the topology and dynamics through which sympathetic circuits modulate hemodynamics, supporting the development of a neuroprosthetic baroreflex that precisely controls blood pressure in rats, monkeys and humans with spinal cord injuries. Here, we describe the continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity over several months in preclinical models of chronic neurological disorders using commercially available telemetry technologies, as well as optogenetic and neuronal tract-tracing procedures specifically adapted to the sympathetic circuitry. Using a blueprint to construct a negative-pressure chamber, the approach enables the reproduction, in rats, of well-controlled and reproducible episodes of hypotension-mimicking orthostatic challenges already used in humans. Blood pressure variations can thus be directly induced and linked to the molecular, functional and anatomical properties of specific neurons in the brainstem, spinal cord and ganglia. Each procedure can be completed in under 2 h, while the construction of the negative-pressure chamber requires up to 1 week. With training, individuals with a basic understanding of cardiovascular physiology, engineering or neuroscience can collect longitudinal recordings of hemodynamics and sympathetic nerve activity over several months.","The present work was supported by a Consolidator Grant from the European Research Council (ERC-2015-CoG HOW2WALKAGAIN 682999), the Swiss National Science Foundation (subsides 310030_130850, CRSII5_183519, BSCGI0 1578000), Compute Canada, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Banting Fellowship, Alberta Innovates Health Solutions, Campus Alberta Neuroscience, the Libin Cardiovascular Institute, the Hotchkiss Brain Institute, PRAXIS, International Foundation for Research in Paraplegia, McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health.

However, the relationship between gaze behavior and brain activation in schizophrenia remains unexamined. Studies in healthy individuals and other clinical samples indicate a relationship between gaze behavior and functional activation in brain regions implicated in facial emotion processing deficits in schizophrenia (e.g., fusiform gyrus), prompting the question of whether a similar relationship exists in schizophrenia. This study examined whether manipulating visual scanpaths during facial emotion perception would modulate functional brain activation in a sample of 23 schizophrenia patients and 26 community controls. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) while viewing pictures of emotional faces. During the typical viewing condition, a fixation cue directed participants' gaze primarily to the eyes and mouth, whereas during the atypical viewing condition gaze was directed to peripheral features. Both viewing conditions elicited a robust response throughout face-processing regions. Typical viewing led to greater activation in visual association cortex including the right inferior occipital gyrus/occipital face area, whereas atypical viewing elicited greater activation in primary visual cortex and regions involved in attentional control. There were no between-groups activation differences in response to faces or interaction between group and gaze manipulation. The results indicate that gaze behavior modulates functional activation in early face-processing regions in individuals with and without schizophrenia, suggesting that abnormal gaze behavior in schizophrenia may contribute to activation abnormalities during facial emotion perception.

The maturation of various neural circuits during adolescence depends, to a large degree, on one's experiences both physical and psychosocial. This occurs through a process of plasticity which is the structural and functional adaptation of the nervous system in response to environmental demands, physiological changes and experiences. During adolescence, this adaptation proceeds upon a backdrop of structural and functional alterations imparted by genetic and epigenetic factors and experiences both prior to birth and during the postnatal period. Plasticity entails an altering of connections between neurons through long-term potentiation (LTP) (which alters synaptic efficiency), synaptogenesis, axonal sprouting, dendritic remodeling, neurogenesis and recruitment (Skaper et al., 2017). Although most empirical evidence for plasticity derives from studies of the sensory systems, recent studies have suggested that during adolescence, social, emotional, and cognitive experiences alter the structure and function of the networks subserving these domains of behavior. Each of these neural networks exhibits heightened vulnerability to experience-dependent plasticity during the sensitive periods which occur in different circuits and different brain regions at specific periods of development. This report will summarize some examples of adaptation which occur during adolescence and some evidence that the adolescent brain responds differently to stimuli compared to adults and children. This symposium, ""Experience during adolescence shapes brain development: from synapses and networks to normal and pathological behavior"" occurred during the Developmental Neurotoxicology Society/Teratology Society Annual Meeting in Clearwater Florida, June 2018. The sections will describe the maturation of the brain during adolescence as studied using imaging technologies, illustrate how plasticity shapes the structure of the brain using examples of pathological conditions such as Tourette's' syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a review of the key molecular systems involved in this plasticity and how some commonly abused substances alter brain development. The role of stimulants used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the plasticity of the reward circuit is then described. Lastly, clinical data promoting an understanding of peer-influences on risky behavior in adolescents provides evidence for the complexity of the roles that peers play in decision making, a phenomenon different from that in the adult. Imaging studies have revealed that activation of the social network by the presence of peers at times of decision making is unique in the adolescent. Since normal brain development relies on experiences which alter the functional and structural connections between cells within circuits and networks to ultimately alter behavior, readers can be made aware of the myriad of ways normal developmental processes can be hijacked. The vulnerability of developing adolescent brain places the adolescent at risk for the development of a life time of abnormal behaviors and mental disorders.","This symposium was funded by the National Science Foundation Grant #BCS 1821940.

MRI studies have shown subtle differences of brain anatomy between people with major depressive disorder and healthy control subjects, but few studies have specifically examined brain anatomical asymmetry in relation to this disorder, and results from those studies have remained inconclusive. At the functional level, some electroencephalography studies have indicated left fronto-cortical hypoactivity and right parietal hypoactivity in depressive disorders, so aspects of lateralized anatomy may also be affected. The authors used pooled individual-level data from data sets collected around the world to investigate differences in laterality in measures of cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and subcortical volume between individuals with major depression and healthy control subjects.
METHODS: The authors investigated differences in the laterality of thickness and surface area measures of 34 cerebral cortical regions in 2,256 individuals with major depression and 3,504 control subjects from 31 separate data sets, and they investigated volume asymmetries of eight subcortical structures in 2,540 individuals with major depression and 4,230 control subjects from 32 data sets. T1-weighted MRI data were processed with a single protocol using FreeSurfer and the Desikan-Killiany atlas. The large sample size provided 80% power to detect effects of the order of Cohen's d=0.1.
RESULTS: The largest effect size (Cohen's d) of major depression diagnosis was 0.085 for the thickness asymmetry of the superior temporal cortex, which was not significant after adjustment for multiple testing. Asymmetry measures were not significantly associated with medication use, acute compared with remitted status, first episode compared with recurrent status, or age at onset.
CONCLUSIONS: Altered brain macro-anatomical asymmetry may be of little relevance to major depression etiology in most cases.",,,American Journal of Psychiatry,,,"Adult; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Databases, Factual; Depressive Disorder, Major; Dominance, Cerebral; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Neuroimaging; Young Adult",2019-07-29,2019,2019-07-29,2019-12-01,176,12,1039-1049,All OA; Bronze,Article,"de Kovel, Carolien G.F.; Aftanas, Lyubomir; Aleman, André; Alexander-Bloch, Aaron F.; Baune, Bernhard T.; Brack, Ivan; Bülow, Robin; Busatto Filho, Geraldo; Carballedo, Angela; Connolly, Colm G.; Cullen, Kathryn R.; Dannlowski, Udo; Davey, Christopher G.; Dima, Danai; Dohm, Katharina; Erwin-Grabner, Tracy; Frodl, Thomas; Fu, Cynthia H.Y.; Hall, Geoffrey B.; Glahn, David C.; Godlewska, Beata; Gotlib, Ian H.; Goya-Maldonado, Roberto; Grabe, Hans Jörgen; Groenewold, Nynke A.; Grotegerd, Dominik; Gruber, Oliver; Harris, Mathew A.; Harrison, Ben J.; Hatton, Sean N.; Hickie, Ian B.; Ho, Tiffany C.; Jahanshad, Neda; Kircher, Tilo; Krämer, Bernd; Krug, Axel; Lagopoulos, Jim; Leehr, Elisabeth J.; Li, Meng; MacMaster, Frank P.; MacQueen, Glenda; McIntosh, Andrew M.; McLellan, Quinn; Medland, Sarah E.; Mueller, Bryon A.; Nenadic, Igor; Osipov, Evgeny; Papmeyer, Martina; Portella, Maria J.; Reneman, Liesbeth; Rosa, Pedro G.P.; Sacchet, Matthew D.; Schnell, Knut; Schrantee, Anouk; Sim, Kang; Simulionyte, Egle; Sindermann, Lisa; Singh, Aditya; Stein, Dan J.; Ubani, Benjamin N.; Van der Wee, Nic J.A.; Van der Werff, Steven J.A.; Veer, Ilya M.; Vives-Gilabert, Yolanda; Völzke, Henry; Walter, Henrik; Walter, Martin; Schreiner, Melinda Westlund; Whalley, Heather; Winter, Nils; Wittfeld, Katharina; Yang, Tony T.; Yüksel, Dilara; Zaremba, Dario; Thompson, Paul M.; Veltman, Dick J.; Schmaal, Lianne; Francks, Clyde","de Kovel, Carolien G.F.

Shorter rTMS courses retaining similar effectiveness would thus increase the practicality and scalability of the technique, and therefore its accessibility. Objective We assessed the feasibility of a novel 5 day accelerated 1 Hz rTMS protocol. We hypothesized that this novel rTMS protocol would be safe and well-tolerated while shortening the overall treatment course. Methods We conducted a prospective, single-arm, open-label feasibility study. Thirty (30) participants received a one-week (5 days) accelerated (8 sessions per day, 40 sessions total) course of 1 Hz rTMS (600 pulses per session, 50-minute intersession interval) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R-DLPFC) using a figure-of-eight coil at 120% of the resting motor threshold (rMT). Primary outcomes were response and remission rates on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Results Response and remission rates 1 week after treatment were 33.3% and 13.3% respectively and increased to 43.3% and 30.0% at follow-up 4 weeks after treatment. No serious adverse events occurred. All participants reported manageable pain levels. Conclusion 1 Hz rTMS administered 8 times daily for 5 days is safe and well-tolerated. Validation in a randomized trial will be required.

595,pub.1142522068,10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100270,,,The relationship between pre-treatment heart rate variability and response to low-frequency accelerated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in major depression,"Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is now the first cause of disability worldwide. So far, no validated and scalable biomarker has been identified to help with response prediction to antidepressant treatment. Cardiac biomarkers such as heart rate variability (HRV) have been studied in MDD, but few studies have examined its potential use for outcome prediction to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Objective We recorded pre-treatment HRV in MDD participants prior to an rTMS course. We hypothesized that higher pre-treatment HRV would be correlated with better clinical outcomes. Methods HRV was recorded as part of a single-arm, open-label rTMS feasibility study. Pre-treatment HRV was assessed in N = 30 MDD participants before they underwent a one-week (5 days, 8 daily sessions, 40 sessions total) accelerated rTMS (arTMS) course using a low-frequency 1 Hz course (600 pulses per session, 50-minute intersession interval) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 120% of the resting motor threshold. Clinical outcomes were captured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). We tested for an association between pre-treatment HRV and clinical outcomes on the BDI-II using a linear mixed effects model. Results Although average BDI-II score significantly changed over time, these changes were not significantly associated with pre-treatment HRV (p = 0.60). This finding remained when adjusting for age, sex, and HR, individually and collectively. Conclusion The current study did not find a relationship between pre-treatment HRV and response to low frequency rTMS. Other approaches using cardiac biomarkers may have potential for response prediction.","JPM would like to thank the Brain Behavior Research Foundation and the Branch Out Neurological Foundation for their financial support of this project.

This article reviews recent research on the co-occurrence of PD and SUD/AUD and discusses how contemporary research on impulsivity-related personality and psychopathology dimensions might partially account for their high comorbidity.Recent FindingsComorbidity between PDs and SUDs/AUD is substantial across population-based and clinical studies and is most apparent in Cluster B PDs. Studies of trait-based impulsivity suggest this comorbidity may be partly explained by UPPS-P model of impulsivity factors (e.g., negative urgency). Research consistent with the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology suggests that impulsivity-relevant psychopathology dimensions, including broader symptom domains (e.g., disinhibited externalizing) and narrower symptom components and maladaptive traits (e.g., risk-taking, delay-discounting), contribute to PD and SUD/AUD comorbidity.SummaryImpulsive personality traits and psychopathology dimensions partially account for the high comorbidity between PD and SUD/AUD diagnoses.",,JWK is supported by a Graduate Grant from the Branch Out Neurological Foundation.,Current Addiction Reports,,,,2023-05-08,2023,2023-05-08,2023-06-01,10,2,122-130,Closed,Article,"Koudys, Jacob W.; Cane, Cody; Nikolova, Yuliya S.; Ruocco, Anthony C.","Koudys, Jacob W.

Low frequency (LF) rTMS has distinct advantages compared to HF rTMS and our previous investigation of a similar design suggested that heart rate (HR) may have biomarker potential for LF rTMS in MDD patients. Our previous study supported the utilization of HR biomarkers for LF-rTMS in MDD and thus this exploratory replication study aims to further investigate, in a different cohort and with a different coil, the effect of 1Hz right hemisphere (R)-DLPFC rTMS on the HR of MDD patients, as well as the potential of using HR as a simple, scalable biomarker to predict rTMS treatment response. Methods 24 participants underwent 30 sessions of accelerated 1Hz R-DLPFC rTMS within 7 days after the baseline ECG session, followed by 20–25 once-a-day sessions 7 days after. The Beck Depression Inventory-II score was used as the primary outcome measure. Results HR significantly decreased during the first 3 min of the rTMS period. Resting HR, HR during rTMS, and the degree of HR reduction were not significantly associated with treatment outcome. Conclusion The results of the current study remain in concordance in trend with that of our previous study despite the use of a less accurate rTMS coil. Therefore, this study further supports the biomarker potential of HR for LF-rTMS in MDD patients.","Declaration of Competing Interest JZS, FM, KD, TR, RZ, MH, LF, HV do not report any conflict of interest.

506,pub.1141599178,10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100250,,,Investigating EEG biomarkers of clinical response to low frequency rTMS in depression,"Background Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective intervention for major depressive disorder (MDD). Completing a full treatment course, however, is costly and time-consuming. Biomarkers of clinical outcome such as baseline resting-state brain activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG) may spare people futile treatment and conserve limited clinical resources. Additionally, investigating changes in EEG power post-treatment could provide insights into the working mechanism of rTMS. Methods 39 MDD patients received 6 daily sessions of accelerated low-frequency (LF) rTMS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 5 days followed by a tapering course of 25 once-daily sessions. Resting-state EEG and heart rate (HR) measures were acquired immediately before and after a single rTMS session at 3 different timepoints: baseline, one week after the final accelerated session, and upon completion of the tapering course. The primary clinical outcome measure was the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). Results High relative baseline theta power in prefrontal areas and high baseline HR were associated with poorer clinical outcome. HR decreased acutely at the beginning of the patients’ first rTMS session but this effect was not associated with treatment outcome. Limitations The main limitations were small sample size and a lack of sham and healthy control group. Conclusion Our results suggest that high relative theta power at baseline may be a marker of poorer response to right-sided LF rTMS. If validated, this easily applicable measure could inform rTMS protocol choice for the individual, thereby potentially speeding up patient recovery and saving clinical resources.",JPM would like to thank the Brain Behaviour Research Foundation and the Branch Out Neurological Foundation for their financial support of this project.,,Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,,,,2021-12,2021,,2021-12,6,,100250,All OA; Gold,Article,"Voetterl, Helena; Miron, Jean-Philippe; Mansouri, Farrokh; Fox, Linsay; Hyde, Molly; Blumberger, Daniel M.; Daskalakis, Zafiris J.; Vila-Rodriguez, Fidel; Sack, Alexander T.; Downar, Jonathan","Voetterl, Helena (Research Institute Brainclinics, Nijmegen, Netherlands; Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Netherlands; Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada); Miron, Jean-Philippe (Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Institute of Medical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), Centre de Recherche du CHUM (CRCHUM) et Département de Psychiatrie, Faculté de Médecine, Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canada); Mansouri, Farrokh (Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Institute of Medical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada); Fox, Linsay (Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada); Hyde, Molly (Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada); Blumberger, Daniel M.

The primary objective of this research was to investigate the association between dispositional mindfulness and the neural correlates of working memory in adolescents. A secondary objective was to examine the link between adolescent dispositional mindfulness and working memory performance.MethodsAdolescents aged 11–18 (M = 13.75, SD = 1.56, n = 83) completed the Adult and Adolescent Mindfulness Scale and a functional magnetic resonance imaging N-back task. The blood oxygen level–dependent signal as well as functional connectivity of the right dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was contrasted between 2-back versus 0-back conditions.ResultsLower blood oxygen level–dependent signal in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was correlated to higher Attention and Awareness scores, controlling for participants’ experience with a mindfulness practice (k = 112, FWEp = .011). Reduced functional connectivity between right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex/supplementary motor area during the 2-back compared to 0-back task was associated with higher Nonreactivity, although this did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Dispositional mindfulness did not correlate to working memory performance.ConclusionsAdolescents with higher levels of Attention and Awareness and Nonreactivity may require less cognitive effort to inhibit distractors for the same level of working memory performance.","This research was supported by funding from Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, awarded to Dr. Daniel Kopala-Sibley.

467,pub.1140333180,10.29173/eureka28758,,,The Neuroregenerative Effects of Intraspinal Microstimulation (ISMS) Following Spinal Cord Injury (SCI),"Background     Intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) is a novel electrical stimulation technique that has demonstrated mobility restoration in animals with spinal cord injury (SCI). This project investigated: 1) the capacity of ISMS to restore functional walking in rats with SCI through 4 weeks of stimulation, and 2) the degree of walking deficit caused by ISMS surgery. Methods     Thirteen Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups: 1) rats with hemi-section SCI (hSCI) and no implants (control group), 2) rats with hSCI and passive ISMS implants (ISMS sham group), and 3) rats with hSCI and implants with active electrical stimulation (ISMS group). All groups were trained to walk on a horizontal ladder and their performance was quantified pre- and post-surgery. Results     We hypothesized that the rats with active ISMS implants would demonstrate the greatest improvement in functional walking compared to both control groups, and that the ISMS sham group would underperform the most. The preoperative functional walking scores of control, sham and ISMS rats were 5.7±0.2, 5.5±0.3 and 5.7±0.1, respectively (7-point scale; mean ± standard error). The post-surgery scores were 3.2±0.9, 2.6±0.6 and 3.3±0.8 for control, sham, and ISMS rats, respectively. Conclusions     As the difference between the post-surgery functional walking scores of ISMS and control rats was not statistically significant, this may indicate that four weeks of ISMS stimulation is not enough to cause rehabilitative effects. Additionally, the ISMS sham group demonstrated impaired functional walking compared to the hSCI control group as predicted.

452,pub.1142638306,10.1088/2632-072x/ac35b4,,,Deconstructing scale-free neuronal avalanches: behavioral transitions and neuronal response,"Observations of neurons in a resting brain and neurons in cultures often display spontaneous scale-free (SF) collective dynamics in the form of information cascades, also called ‘neuronal avalanches’. This has motivated the so called critical brain hypothesis which posits that the brain is self-tuned to a critical point or regime, separating exponentially-growing dynamics from quiescent states, to achieve optimality. Yet, how such optimality of information transmission is related to behavior and whether it persists under behavioral transitions has remained a fundamental knowledge gap. Here, we aim to tackle this challenge by studying behavioral transitions in mice using two-photon calcium imaging of the retrosplenial cortex (RSC)—an area of the brain well positioned to integrate sensory, mnemonic, and cognitive information by virtue of its strong connectivity with the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and primary sensory cortices. Our work shows that the response of the underlying neural population to behavioral transitions can vary significantly between different sub-populations such that one needs to take the structural and functional network properties of these sub-populations into account to understand the properties at the total population level. Specifically, we show that the RSC contains at least one sub-population capable of switching between two different SF regimes, indicating an intricate relationship between behavior and the optimality of neuronal response at the subgroup level. This asks for a potential reinterpretation of the emergence of self-organized criticality in neuronal systems.","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, as well as Alberta Innovates-Technology Futures (AITF), Branch Out Neurological Foundation, New Frontiers Research Fund, Beswick Fellowship.",,Journal of Physics Complexity,,,,2021-11-18,2021,2021-11-18,2021-12-01,2,4,45010,All OA; Gold,Article,"Curic, Davor; Ivan, Victorita E; Cuesta, David T; Esteves, Ingrid M; Mohajerani, Majid H; Gruber, Aaron J; Davidsen, Jörn","Curic, Davor (Complexity Science Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta T2N 1N4, Canada); Ivan, Victorita E (Canadian Centre for Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta T1K 3M4, Canada); Cuesta, David T (Canadian Centre for Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta T1K 3M4, Canada); Esteves, Ingrid M (Canadian Centre for Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta T1K 3M4, Canada); Mohajerani, Majid H (Canadian Centre for Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta T1K 3M4, Canada); Gruber, Aaron J (Canadian Centre for Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta T1K 3M4, Canada); Davidsen, Jörn (Complexity Science Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta T2N 1N4, Canada; Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta T2N 4N1, Canada)","Curic, Davor (University of Calgary)","Curic, Davor (University of Calgary); Ivan, Victorita E (University of Lethbridge); Cuesta, David T (University of Lethbridge); Esteves, Ingrid M (University of Lethbridge); Mohajerani, Majid H (University of Lethbridge); Gruber, Aaron J (University of Lethbridge); Davidsen, Jörn (University of Calgary; University of Calgary)",13,7,,3.37,https://doi.org/10.1088/2632-072x/ac35b4,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142638306,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning; 51 Physical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,

The incremental utility of dispositional mindfulness in predicting psychopathology over and above the Big Five was investigated using a facet-level approach. One hundred and thirty-one adolescents (M = 13.76, SD = 1.65) who had a parent with a history of mood or anxiety disorders completed measures of dispositional mindfulness and facets of mindfulness (i.e., attention and awareness, nonreactivity, nonjudgement, and self-acceptance), the Big Five model of personality, psychopathology (i.e., internalizing, externalizing, and total problems scales), and mindfulness experience. Hierarchical multiple regressions were performed. Controlling for sex, mindfulness experience, and theory driven Big Five factors, higher dispositional mindfulness related to fewer internalizing, externalizing, and total problems. Mindfulness facet self-acceptance was key to this association. Nonreactivity moderated effects of attention and awareness, such that higher attention and awareness correlated to fewer internalizing and total problems only when nonreactivity was also high. Therefore, self-acceptance and nonreactive observing may be unique components of mindfulness that have implications for adolescent psychopathological symptoms, even controlling for well-established personality vulnerability factors. Future adolescent mindfulness intervention research and practice should emphasize techniques that involve observation while concurrently enhancing nonreactivity and self-acceptance.",,"This research was supported by funding from Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the Brain and Behaviour Research Foundation, awarded to Dr. Daniel Kopala-Sibley.

Microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the central nervous system, undergo drastic changes in morphology in response to various stimuli, with many classifications proposed in recent years. Increased availability of advanced analysis software to study microglial morphology represents a step forward in the field. However, whether the use of advanced analysis tools provides equivalent or varied outcomes remains undetermined. This work re-analyzed raw data—previously processed using a standard 2D microglial morphology analysis method—using 3D analysis methods. Our previously published article observed significant changes in microglial morphology using the 2D analysis method in the mouse ventral hippocampus after administration of a ketogenic diet and exposure to repeated social defeat stress in young adult male mice. Overall, we observed different statistical outcomes in the 3D dataset compared to the previously published 2D results, with both maintained and new findings. However, overall conclusions on microglial morphology changes remain consistent between methods. Lastly, we highlight the difference between a nested statistical design, which considers between animal variability and the dependency of within animal measurements, and a non-nested design. When a nested design is employed, many of the statistically significant post hoc comparisons are lost. Overall, we highlight and discuss differences between 2D and 3D microglial morphology analysis and explore the contribution of individual cell and animal variability to statistical outcomes.","Declaration of competing interest M-ÈT is Editor-In-Chief of Glial Health Research.
